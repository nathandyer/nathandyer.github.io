I"®<p>For years now Iâ€™ve been trying to limit how many Google services I use, but there is one that I just canâ€™t seem to break away from no matter how hard I try: YouTube.</p>

<p>I watch relatively little video, and am not subscribed to any streaming or cable services, but the small amount of content I do watch all comes from YouTube, and I get too much enjoyment out of it to be able to give it up entirely. I donâ€™t like Google as a company, and I find the way YouTube treats creators and employees to be absolutely terrible, but at the same time I really like all the content that people pour into the service.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s where <a href="https://podsync.net/">Podsync</a> comes in, which effectively turns a YouTube channel into a proper video podcast feed, complete with artwork and descriptions. Doing it this way has really changed how I interact with YouTube. I find that I stay more up-to-date with all my subscriptions, and itâ€™s nice being able to have it integrated with my other podcast feeds. And of course itâ€™s nice being able to load it all right into Vocal.</p>

<p>I should end with a caveat that this is pretty clearly a violation of YouTubeâ€™s terms of service, and it also bypasses any ads, so effectively youâ€™re using Googleâ€™s bandwidth without them getting anything back in return from you. Whether this is unethical or not I will leave as a personal decision to the reader. I for one see it as a social good.</p>
