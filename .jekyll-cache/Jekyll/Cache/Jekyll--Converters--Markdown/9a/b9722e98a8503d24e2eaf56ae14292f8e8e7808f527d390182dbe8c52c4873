I"ñ(<p>(Small disclaimer up front: I‚Äôm a huge fan of System76, have been to their office on several occasions, and am friends with a number of people on their staff so I admit to a certain amount of bias. That said, I made every attempt to be purely objective here in my review.)</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had my <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/galago">System76 Galago Pro</a> laptop for about five months now, and figured it was as good as time as any to go ahead and jot down my thoughts on the laptop. It‚Äôs hard to really know how you feel about such an important machine right from the get-go. If you‚Äôre like me, you spend most of your day staring at and interacting with your ‚Äúdaily driver‚Äù, and only after a few months can you know how you genuinely feel about it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll go ahead and tell you that it‚Äôs my favorite laptop that I‚Äôve had in ages. It‚Äôs a nearly perfect device for me, but at the same time I‚Äôm not sure that it would be a perfect device for everyone. And I‚Äôll explain why.</p>

<h2 id="physical-design-and-build-quality">Physical Design and Build Quality</h2>

<p>There is something about the look of the laptop that I am absolutely in love with, but I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on what it is. Perhaps it‚Äôs the angle of the hinge, or the stylish System76 logo on the lid, or the perfect balance between elegant design and industrialism, but there is something about the overall look of the laptop that I prefer even over MacBooks.</p>

<p>I had a few problems with my previous laptop, a Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, and they are all solved here. Annoyingly, the rubber strip on the bottom to keep the laptop from sliding on a table started losing its adhesive on my XPS 13, and for years every time you‚Äôd touch the laptop your hands would get super sticky with glue. The rubber strip on the bottom of the Galago, however, is nice and large, and hasn‚Äôt budged an inch. No glue residue to speak of. The XPS 13 also had some serious cooling issues because (almost all of) the ventilation was done through the bottom vent which inevitably got covered when sitting on your lap, or resting on a blanket, or even on certain tables. Wonderfully, though, it seems that the Galago intakes air through the bottom, which then flows out via a large and very effective vent near the hinge area. There are times when the fans turn on and it‚Äôs noticeably loud, but it doesn‚Äôt do that annoyingly often, and I love knowing how well it‚Äôs cooling the laptop when it is running.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/2018-04-06/vents.jpeg" alt="The vents inside the hinge" /></p>

<p>I love the fact that this laptop has actual LEDs on the front to show me when it‚Äôs powered on and when it‚Äôs accessing the SSD. I find that information extremely useful in day-to-day operation, and am sad that the trend these days is to remove these indicators in favor of an uninterrupted slab of aluminum.</p>

<h2 id="display">Display</h2>

<p>What can I say, the display is just absolutely gorgeous. This HiDPI display has a native resolution of 3200x1600, which means everything appears at the scale of a 1600x900 display, the definitive ideal resolution for a display this size (the XPS 13 had a 1080p display at the same screen size and was just too darn small).</p>

<p>The colors are accurate and vivid, the viewing angles are great, and it gets super bright. All around, I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the built-in display. Text is crisp and images are gorgeous. It honestly looks better than the MacBook Pro Retina that I use for work.</p>

<p>The only complaint, and this probably falls more in the area of performance, is that running at that resolution makes everything feel ever-so-slightly sluggish due to the fact that there‚Äôs not a dedicated graphics card handling that extra work. Both Pantheon and GNOME Shell at times feel sluggish. If I‚Äôm in a mood where performance is especially important I sometimes do single monitor mode on an external 1080p display, and it flies. That said, it‚Äôs not so under-powered that using the built-in display is a hindrance. It‚Äôs mainly just the OS components that lag a bit, and I‚Äôm willing to bet 90% of people won‚Äôt notice it in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-and-trackpad">Keyboard and Trackpad</h2>

<p>As far as laptop keyboards go, this is one of the better ones that I have used. There is a fair bit of travel and bounce, and it‚Äôs a much more enjoyable typing experience than my old XPS 13. I would say that it‚Äôs either on par or slightly better than the MacBook Pro keyboards (the classic style too, not just the new butterfly mechanisms). I absolutely love it. If I were to rank laptop keyboards through the ages I would go ThinkPad -&gt; Galago -&gt; MacBook -&gt; All Others.</p>

<p>The trackpad, unfortunately, is a different story.</p>

<p>The surface is plastic-y and dissatisfying to move your finger across, and is on the small side when compared to the trackpads you might find on both Apple laptops and the Dell XPS 13. I also don‚Äôt find the physical buttons very enjoyable to use. I much prefer the clickpad style. I think it‚Äôs fair to say that the trackpad is the most disappointing feature of the laptop.</p>

<p>That said, it‚Äôs not the worst trackpad I‚Äôve ever used, and because I‚Äôm almost always connected to a mouse it‚Äôs certainly not a deal-breaker.</p>

<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>

<p>The speakers are quiet and lack significant bass. They‚Äôll do in a pinch, but they don‚Äôt pack anywhere near the punch of speakers in similar devices (or even my iPad Pro or iPhone).</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>This laptop is very, very fast, particularly when you compare it with other ultrabooks or devices in a similar category. It can be configured with different processors, memory, and storage options so it‚Äôs hard to say definitively how fast it is, but mine is a quad-core with hyperthreading, so I end up with 8 virtual cores for execution. I went with 8GB of RAM, but the wonderful thing (and all-too-rare nowadays) is that I can open it up and throw in more memory any time I want, so I will probably upgrade to 16 or maybe even 32GB of RAM in the future.</p>

<p>Bottom line: this thing outperforms my MacBook Pro, and is the fastest machine I‚Äôve ever owned. Sure, there are gaming laptops and desktops that will blow it out of the water, but for the size, form factor, and price, it does better than it really has any right doing.</p>

<h2 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, I feel like this would be the deal-breaker for 90% of people, and justifiably so. On average I get around two hours of battery life on this thing. It‚Äôs not defective, that‚Äôs just the reality of having a comparatively small battery coupled with operating systems that just aren‚Äôt fine-tuned enough to eek out every extra bit of juice that it can. If I only use it for web browsing and take my time I can get close to three hours, but similarly I‚Äôve seen a couple times where watching 1080p YouTube videos can cause it to last less than an hour and a half. I feel like in 2018 that‚Äôs kind of a deal-breaker.</p>

<p>That said, I use it all day long for work, and both at work and home it‚Äôs plugged into an AC adapter (I purchased an extra one for this reason), so battery life just doesn‚Äôt matter much to me any more. If I were still in college this probably wouldn‚Äôt work great for me, but I don‚Äôt really go to coffee shops or the library or anything, so battery life only slightly matters to me.</p>

<h2 id="ordering-and-delivering">Ordering and Delivering</h2>

<p>Ordering the laptop is one of the most pleasant and straight-forward processes that I‚Äôve seen from from PC manufacturers. It‚Äôs easy to see and customize all your options, and checking out is dead simple as well. Browsing the catalog is great as well, so purely from the store aspect, ordering from System76 is lovely.</p>

<p>That said, the time between placing an order and having a computer show up at your door is way too long in my opinion. When you place the order they make a note that says something along the lines of ‚Äúwe build every single machine to order,‚Äù like it‚Äôs a point of pride, but the fact is that it takes around 3‚Äì5 days for them to build your machine before they even ship it. This sounds great, but let‚Äôs be honest for a minute: it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm at Subway ordering a sandwich here, making it to order doesn‚Äôt provide me any direct benefit. And I completely understand that they need to do it this way in order to support all the various customization options, but I would imagine that for certain popular combinations (for example, the base model like I got) they might go ahead and make up a few ahead of time so they can ship them out relatively quickly. At the end of the day, I found myself without a computer for two weeks after ordering, and in this day and age that‚Äôs a genuine problem. I‚Äôm hoping that their new Denver-based manufacturing efforts can help speed up this process.</p>

<h2 id="other-comments">Other Comments</h2>

<p>I absolutely love the built-in ethernet jack. There are times when I need to plug into a network with a physical connection, and I love not having to use a dongle. Plus, the little flappy door is brilliant. I can see this being one of the pieces that wears out over time, but at least for now, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it.</p>

<p>Also, holy cow is the unboxing experience wonderful. The box that arrives is really neat, and the artwork that <a href="https://twitter.com/kate_hazen">Kate Hazen</a> designed looks great and has an incredible amount of charm and personality. It makes the unboxing experience exciting and memorable, so hats of to them on it.</p>

<h2 id="overall-thoughts-tldr">Overall Thoughts (TL;DR)</h2>

<p>I absolutely love my laptop. I love the way it looks. I love how it performs. I love that incredible HiDPI display. I wish it had better battery life, I wish the trackpad was much more enjoyable to use, and I wish the speakers had a little more ‚Äúumphf‚Äù to them. That said, this thing is rugged, reliable, and a pleasure to interact with each day. It‚Äôs my favorite laptop in years.</p>
