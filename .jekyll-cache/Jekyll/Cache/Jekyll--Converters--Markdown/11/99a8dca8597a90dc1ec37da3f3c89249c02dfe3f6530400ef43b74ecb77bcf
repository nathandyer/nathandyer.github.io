I"Ž<p>Before I ever was a Bernie Sanders supporter, I was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig">Lawrence Lessig</a> supporter. As a free culture fanatic and huge proponent of both copyleft and the public domain, Iâ€™ve been a follower and supporter of Lessig since I was a teenager. Perhaps even more significantly than his work with the public domain and the Creative Commons, in recent years he has been nigh obsessed with fixing democracy by addressing the problems surrounding the ways that campaigns are financed. While there are indeed countless goals to strive for politically and social issues in dire need of attention, Lessig argues that campaign finance is far and away the biggest issue that we as a nation face. Democracy, simply put, <a href="http://republic.lessig.org/">is fundamentally broken</a>. Corporations sway the results of all major elections by throwing absurd amounts of money toward the campaigns of politicians that will in turn treat them favorably when they go to create and amend legislation, or perform executive duties. According to Lessig, we have to <a href="http://fixdemocracyfirst.org/">fix democracy first</a>. You cannot have social justice or fair, equal representation in government when the game is rigged from the start. I would agree with that. Therefore, as you might expect, I was thrilled when he announced that he would be running for President (although he never had a chance of winning, it would appear that he did convince Bernie Sanders of the need to tackle campaign finance reform immediately upon entering office, <a href="https://medium.com/equal-citizens/on-what-happened-today-3b5f6ad28784#.j5pqcxx21">which had a ripple effect when Bernie then convinced Hillary Clinton to make similar promises in relative exchange for his endorsement.</a> Iâ€™m skeptical, yet hopeful, that Clinton will follow through with this should she be elected as President.).</p>
