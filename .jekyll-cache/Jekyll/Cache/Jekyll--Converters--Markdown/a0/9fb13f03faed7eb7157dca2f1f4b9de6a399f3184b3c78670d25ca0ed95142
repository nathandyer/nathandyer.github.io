I"½<p>A couple months ago <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/332">I saw that support for the Apple Magic Trackpad 2 was being added to the 4.20 Linux Kernel</a>. Once upon a time, around 2011 or so, I used the original Magic Trackpad as my daily driver for all my cursor manipulation needs. I found it really enjoyable and precise, particularly when it came to scrolling through code and reading lengthy articles, and recommended it often to people whenever theyâ€™d ask. Unfortunately, as time progressed there were some regressions in the Linux drivers that made it not work as reliably, and a veritable smorgasbord of odd Bluetooth behaviors and downright failures caused me to fall out of love, so I dumped it like a crappy prom date. I also hated having to keep putting AA batteries in it like a caveman (and yes, I know that you can buy rechargable ones - youâ€™re talking to the one moron on the planet that bought the $29 Apple ones).</p>
