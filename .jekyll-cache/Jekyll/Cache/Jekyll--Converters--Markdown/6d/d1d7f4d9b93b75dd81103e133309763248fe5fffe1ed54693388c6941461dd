I"§<p>Here I am staring down the proverbial tunnel, face-to-face with the inevitable end of yet another year. I always feel a knot in my stomach when it really dawns on me that another year of my life has just vanished, in many respects without a trace, but this year that feeling is particularly bad. For one, thereâ€™s an added sense of helplessness thanks to my busted up, momentarily useless leg. I havenâ€™t been in my house in several weeks, and cannot return for several more. That sense of longing to return home amplifies the overall melancholy of this time of year. But thereâ€™s also the general disappointment in me having not accomplished all that I set out to do.</p>
