I"ä<p>Friday evening was my 6 week follow-up with my orthopaedist. I went into the appointment with two specific goals: I wanted to be well enough to start putting weight on my foot and perhaps even cut down to one crutch, and I wanted desperately to be given the green light to drive my stick shift pickup truck (a campaign to which I assigned the hashtag #OneClutchOneCrutch). After being called back to the examination room I was sent to have new X-Rays. With that task completed, the doctor came in, reviewed the results, checked my foot, and performed various tests to make sure I could still feel and move my foot in various ways. With everything to his satisfaction, I was thankfully cleared for pretty much everything I hoped for.</p>
