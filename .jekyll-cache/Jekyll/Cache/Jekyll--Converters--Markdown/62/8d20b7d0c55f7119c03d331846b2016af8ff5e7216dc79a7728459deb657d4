I"‡<p>I wanted to explain a little bit about what all Iâ€™ve been through the past month, and why Iâ€™ve not been as active online recently. Everything started on June 30th. I was feeling <em>off</em> that day: a loss of appetite, a chest that ached like I had indigestion, and overall general sluggishness. I figured it was something I ate, or a little bug of some sort, and that it would work itself out on its own. Later that night someone was looking at one of the scars from my ankle surgery and noticed that I had three bright red dots around it. I figured they were nothing â€” tiny little bug bites, or perhaps new freckles or something.</p>
