I"<p>This week the news of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition">Spotify buying two well-regarded podcast production companies</a> came across my desk. It is reasonably well known that I am of the opinion that bundling podcasts in with music apps is a terrible idea from a user experience perspective, but those feelings alone werenâ€™t what caused this news story to stick in my craw. No, what really twists my knickers is that this is the antithesis of the spirit of podcasting.</p>
