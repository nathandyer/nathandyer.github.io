I"”<p>Last weekend when I went home to visit with my parents they made fun of me for walking through their door with a backpack across my shoulders, like Iâ€™ve done ever day since middle school. â€œWe thought youâ€™d outgrow it by now!â€ they told me. Itâ€™s funny that they brought it up, because my relentless habit of lugging a backpack around is something that I have been mulling over in my head on my own for a while. Truth be told, I think they touched on an insecurity.</p>

<p>And then, as the universe often somehow manages to pull off, the next day at work I kept seeing the same <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/adult-back-packs-fashion-office-etiquette-20190701.html">opinion piece about adults wearing backpacks published in the Philadelphia Inquirer</a> float across my social media timelines. Every comment attached to the article was some variation of either mild annoyance or at least a scoffing reference to â€œold man yells at cloud.â€</p>

<p>I think thereâ€™s something to be said for the amazing idea that, push come to shove, most our lives can fit in a single sack that we can carry around with us at all times. I know for me, I never leave the house without my laptop, headphones, and an ereader. Between those three devices I can access and enjoy literally every piece of media in my life. Every picture Iâ€™ve ever taken of my family and friends, my entire bookshelf, my movie library, all my music, all my electronic games â€” everything is always with me. Itâ€™s incredibly convenient to be able to have pretty much all your stuff with you at all times.</p>

<p>I must admit thinking to myself that carrying a backpack around doesnâ€™t feel particularly adult-y, though. I wonder if deep down the teachers and students whose computers Iâ€™m responsible for fixing each day in my â€œreal jobâ€ are judging me for it. But what are the alternatives? A brief case? No wayâ€” way too serious and stuffy. I canâ€™t pull it off. That really would earn me a one-way ticket to â€œamateursville.â€ I mean,, who would I be kidding? I suppose I could graduate to a messenger bag, but Iâ€™m not convinced theyâ€™re much of an improvement, and I know that ergonomically they put more stress on your shoulders and back.</p>

<p>Plus, I <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRZC0V3/">finally found a backpack that I really like</a>. It is perfect for my needs and Iâ€™ve carried it every day for years now.</p>

<p>So for me, the convenience of a backpack outweighs the fashion faux pas and the perceived immaturity the older generations seem to place on it. I donâ€™t see me giving it up any time soon. I do agree with the authorâ€™s point about etiquette â€” if youâ€™re wearing a backpack in a big crowd, just take the darn thing off and carry it in front of you so itâ€™s in your immediate space. Aside from that, just embrace and love the backpack.</p>
