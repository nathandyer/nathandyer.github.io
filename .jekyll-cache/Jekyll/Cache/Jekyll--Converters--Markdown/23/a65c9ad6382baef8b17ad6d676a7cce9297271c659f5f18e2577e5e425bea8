I"S<p>Most of the pictures from the actual System76 portion of my trip were included in Part One. This post is going to be much less exciting. Itâ€™s primarily just pictures of the food I ate and stuff I found while roaming the streets of Denver. That said, I do want to comment on a few pictures that <a href="http://blog.system76.com/post/135001394288/last-month-we-flew-8-system76fan-winners-and">System76 posted on their blog </a> about the event.</p>

<strong>Photo property of System76</strong>. For some reason, I find this picture absolutely hilarious. Here, Cassidy is turning the heat up trying to put pressure on me for my â€˜Human, Robot, or Cyborgâ€™ test. Iâ€™m trying to play it cool and look smug, but I end up lookingâ€¦ grumpy? Confused? I donâ€™t know. Either way, comedy gold.</p>

<strong>Photo property of System76</strong>. I really like this picture of all of us hanging out and enjoying each others company. Thatâ€™s really what the whole event was about.</p>

Friday night I went to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sliceworks-denver">Sliceworks</a>, which I had heard great things about. The pizza was phenomenal, and you canâ€™t beat the value- ~$5 for a slice of pizza and a cold beverage.</p>

Taking the light rail back into Denver. I love how great the public transportation is in Colorado.</p>

Exploring the 16th Street Mall</p>

So, thatâ€™s a thing in Denver.</p>

<p>Okay, so story time. I spent a good part of Saturday exploring the 16th Street Mall. I had set aside $30 for a nice meal while I was in town, but I didnâ€™t really know which restaurant I should go to, so I decided I would keep walking and eat at the first one whose name made me laugh.</p>

<p>That was when I stumbled upon <strong>The Tilted Kilt.</strong> I had never heard of it before, so I just assumed it was just some local Denver restaurant. I looked up the menu online and saw that they had lots of stuff I would eat, and that the prices were affordable, and that it had good ratings, so I decided that would be my lunch of choice.</p>

<p>I swear, I had no idea that the staff wore these uniforms:

I felt like an incredible pervert / misogynist the entire time I was eating. That was, until they brought out this beauty:

That was, without a doubt, the most delicious meal Iâ€™ve ever had in my life. It was incredible. The ribs were heavenly and the fries were the perfect mixture of crispy and floppy. I cannot recommend it enough.</p>

<p>As I was walking back to take the light rail to Englewood again, I heard street musicians playing jazz music. What a perfect way to wrap up my time in Denver. That night Cassidy and Katie cooked a really amazing dish for me, then we spent the evening talking about elementary and laughing about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/aromanstuff/videos">Avi Romanoffâ€™s amazing YouTube videos</a>. The next morning, Cassidy made me a caramel latte, then I hailed an Uber and ran off to the airport. I could not have asked for a better trip. Thanks to everyone who made it rock.</p>
