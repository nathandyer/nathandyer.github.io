I"!<p>A book detailing the gruesome and unsettling aspects of what happens to your remains after death might not sound like the kind of book you would want to pick up and read during your leisure time, or in my case the lull between Christmas and New Year, but ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory’ by Caitlin Doughty is an incredibly captivating and thought-provoking book. This informative, eye opening pseudo-memoir approaches the topic of death in a way that is entirely respectful and frank, yet at the same time lighthearted and humorous— a difficult balance to achieve. The author’s great personality and sarcastic sense of humor, combined with real-life stories from a crematorium, made it so I couldn’t put it down. I ended up reading it in a single day.</p>
