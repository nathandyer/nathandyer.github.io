I"ÿ<p>Since the moment I first heard about it Iâ€™ve really liked USB-C from both a theoretical and philosophical standpoint, but over the past month being away from home Iâ€™ve come to appreciate it on a whole new, visceral level. Naturally, part of my newfound appreciation stems from having new devices that actually use USB-C. I know it seems like such a miniscule and unimportant thing, but the way it has improved my day-to-day life shouldnâ€™t be understated, especially as of late with a broken ankle.</p>
