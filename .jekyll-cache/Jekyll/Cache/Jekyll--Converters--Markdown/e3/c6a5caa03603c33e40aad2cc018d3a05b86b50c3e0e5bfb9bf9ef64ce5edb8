I"Ø<p>Since moving into my house ‚Äúfor real‚Äù over two years ago, the most urgent, much-needed renovation was my bathroom. When my house was originally built it featured a wrap-around porch and no indoor bathroom (think outhouse). Eventually, part of the porch was turned into a bathroom. I believe the bathroom came along some time in the 50s, then it was remodeled in the 70s. Since then, it hasn‚Äôt been touched. Until now.</p>
