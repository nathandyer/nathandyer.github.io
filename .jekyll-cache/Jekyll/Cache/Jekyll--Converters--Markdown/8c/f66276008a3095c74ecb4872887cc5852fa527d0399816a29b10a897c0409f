I"¿<p>After not having had a vacation in over two years I decided that this year, no matter what, I was going to get away for a week. I contemplated a few different options, but ultimately I decided I needed to scratch an itch I had developed recently and give camping the old college try. Although I had gone camping with my parents in an RV many times as a kid, Iâ€™d never gone tent camping, and Iâ€™d never really â€œroughed itâ€ on my own.</p>
