I"ê<p><strong>Needle &amp; Thread.</strong> For those who are familiar with my projects, Needle &amp; Thread has been an easter egg that you might have seen at some point before now (like on our <a href="https://www.transifex.com/needle-and-thread/vocal/">Transifex</a> page). It has been like our own little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma_Initiative">Dharma Initiative</a>â€” a shadowy organization with some secret meaning, but no obvious answers.</p>

<p><img src="http://needleandthread.co/logo.svg" alt="Needle &amp; Thread's Logo" /></p>

<p>Tonight, not only am I going to tell you what it is, Iâ€™m also going to be outlining several major changes that it will bring for Vocal and Birdie. This is the first (and biggest) of a set of announcements and sneak peeks leading up to the release of Vocal 2.0 here in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Having multiple, separate projects is difficult to keep up with.</strong> You end up with multiple social media accounts, multiple websites and blogs, multiple organizations on GitHub, and- well, you get the picture.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always dreamed of starting a little company making free and open source software. Thatâ€™s what Needle &amp; Thread is. <strong>Itâ€™s simply the parent organization that will house all my projects.</strong> I am in the process of filing paperwork to establish an LLC, so it will soon be small company in order to make the business aspects of my life simpler, but really itâ€™s a way for me to keep my projects in one spot. <strong>It makes it easier for you, it makes it easier for me, and opens up a world of possibilities</strong> which I will talk more about in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>Without saying too much, here are some changes you can expect to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Vocal Twitter and Google+ accounts will automatically become accounts for the LLC</li>
  <li>Announcements for all of the projects will go through the Needle &amp; Thread social media accounts, and will be posted on the company blog</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/needleandthreadsoftware">We have a new Facebook page</a></li>
  <li>The Birdie Twitter account will be more or less abandoned, with a pinned Tweet directing people to the Needle &amp; Thread account</li>
  <li>The vocalproject.net domain will redirect to the project page on the Needle &amp; Thread site. We lost the birdieapp.eu domain a while ago due to a number of reasons, and I decided to not pursue getting it back because I anticipated the change. That domain is just gone and will not redirect, as it is entirely out of my control</li>
  <li>All our GitHub repos will become a part of the new Needle &amp; Thread organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a lot more that Iâ€™ve forgotten to mention, but thatâ€™s the gist. If you have any questions, please send them my way. I hope you are all as excited about this as I am. Lots of great new things are in store.</p>
