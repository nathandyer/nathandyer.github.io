I"Í<p>I must admit I was wrong about something (among many other things): wireless charging is amazing.</p>

<p>When I first heard about it I made fun of the idea. Who is so lazy that they canâ€™t be bothered to plug in their phones for a few minutes to let it recharge?</p>

<p>But then I got a new phone that supported wireless charging, and for the sake of satisfying my curiosity I purchased a wireless charger. Itâ€™s such a simple little thing (and inexpensive too), but it has genuinely improved my life in a small but measurable way. I used to let my phone get as close to the brink of death as possible, but now whenever Iâ€™m lounging in bed or working at my desk I just naturally set it down on the little cradle. I donâ€™t have to physically think about doing anything (other than making sure itâ€™s in the right spot), and with just that one little change suddenly my phone is always charged. To paraphrase Forest Gump, thatâ€™s one less thing I have to think about.</p>

<p>And sure, I know that itâ€™s slower than wired charging, but the fact is it doesnâ€™t matter because my phone is just always charged and I never have to think about it.</p>

<p>So I was wrong. Sometimes the little life improvements add up.</p>
