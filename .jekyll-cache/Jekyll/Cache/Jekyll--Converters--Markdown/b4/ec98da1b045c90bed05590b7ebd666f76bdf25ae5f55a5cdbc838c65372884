I"Ú<p>Like most young men, I learned to shave when I was barely a teenager. It was something I watched my Dad do growing up and I thought it had to be the manliest thing I had ever seen, so naturally I wanted to start doing it myself the split second I first noticed a couple patches of peach fuzz growing on the outer edges of my cheeks. I learned to do it exactly how Dad did it my whole life: pour a sink full of water, squirt the shaving gel into the palm of your hand out of the tube with the giant button on top, make it foamy by clapping your hands a few times, then slather it on your face until there is complete coverage. From there, stick a cartridge on top of your razor handle and go to town until the hair is gone.</p>
