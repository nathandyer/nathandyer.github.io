I"s<p>TL;DR: This is not a major announcement of any kind. Nothing is really changing (aside from the fact that <strong>my available development time is about to skyrocket</strong>). Vocal and Birdie 2.0 are still in development and will be released before long. This is just a personal update about where I’ve been, what I’m doing right now, and what I plan to do.</p>
