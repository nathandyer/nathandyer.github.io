I"<p>I was sitting at a Waffle House counter about a year ago, enjoying a delicious and bountiful breakfast, when an older gentleman walked in and sat down at a very particular chair. He hadnâ€™t made his seating decision haphazardly â€” no, he knew precisely where he wanted to sit, and made a beeline for it. Pulling the chair out from the counter, the waitress said â€œmorning Frank, you want your ususal?â€</p>
