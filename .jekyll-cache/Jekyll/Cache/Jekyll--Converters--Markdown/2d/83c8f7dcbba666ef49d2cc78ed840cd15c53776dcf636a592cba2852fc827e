I"Ò<p>Since moving into my house ‚Äúfor real‚Äù over two years ago, the most urgent, much-needed renovation was my bathroom. When my house was originally built it featured a wrap-around porch and no indoor bathroom (think outhouse). Eventually, part of the porch was turned into a bathroom. I believe the bathroom came along some time in the 50s, then it was remodeled in the 70s. Since then, it hasn‚Äôt been touched. Until now.</p>

<p>Here, you can see the bathroom at its starting point. The stains in the toilet were permanent (the filth ate into the porcelin I suppose). No matter how much scrubbing I did, no matter what tools I used, nothing could get the stains out of the bottom, which made it look like it was always filthy. It grossed me out so bad.</p>

<p>The tub was shorter than the walls, so a weird makeshift board was shimmied and caulked. Water liked to hide in the crevices and turn everything a really putrid brown color. This grungey photo was taken not too long after I bleached the caulk.</p>

<p>The custom vanity/cabinet was made out of cheap plywood. It actually held up okay for forty years, but it needed to go.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>

<p>After trying to find a contractor, I decided to call up an old family friend who has done several jobs for us in the past. After a few false starts, he eventually showed up on May 7th and the demolition began.</p>

<p>Much to my fear, the floor around the toilet was completely rotted out. When my grandfather put the toilet in all those years ago he had neglected to use a flange. It was horrific.</p>

<p>Luckily, the vanity came out pretty easily.</p>

<p>After a single evening, the bathroom was more or less demolished. I thanked my contractor, went to my parents‚Äô house (so I could stay somewhere with a bathroom), then went to work the next day and expected to see my contractor that evening.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt.</p>

<h2 id="the-horror-show">The Horror Show</h2>

<p>After several calls and back-and-forth chats, he eventually showed by up a week or two later, on May 18th. In the interim I had attempted to use my downstairs bathroom (which is minimally functional), but the toilet overflowed and I was trying to avoid it by staying with my parents for a few weeks. Although it was nice to be back with the folks, I wanted to go back home, so I moved back and learned the subtle manipulations my downstairs toilet required to not overflow.</p>

<p>By the time he returned I had taken most of the wallpaper off the wall, so once he showed up everything could be knocked out super fast. Or at least that was the way I had envisioned it.</p>

<p>On May 19th he returned and started ripping out the rotten wood. Not only was the plywood bad, but so was some of the subflooring. Luckily, the joists were okay (as I would soon find out, they were pretty much the only things in decent shape).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/bathroom/11.jpeg" alt="The pit" /></p>

<p>With that, I had an open pit in my house down into what I lovingly refer to as my ‚Äòsnake hole‚Äô (crawlspace) in my house, which in addition to letting any slithering beast into my house that wanted to visit (I now have a resident snake that likes to shed its skin and crap everywhere, but I can‚Äôt find him), it made the entire house smell like dirt and insulation.</p>

<p>Naturally, I assumed my contractor would be there in the next day or two. But he wasn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the last I‚Äôve seen of him.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-beginning">A New Beginning</h2>

<p>I contacted another contractor (who has been really good, I‚Äôll tell you up front). He inspected my house the day I called him, but told me I‚Äôd have to have a plumber look at the plumbing. It turns out, I had PVC going into a really strange cast iron ‚Äúboot,‚Äù which then went out a copper pipe to the septic take. The plumber determined that nothing was salvagable, so I had to have all the plumbing redone. This was a horror show, but at least there was some forward momentum.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/bathroom/12.jpeg" alt="Forward progress" /></p>

<p>Fast forward to June 9th, with the plumbing done. I let my contractor know, and he scheduled to come out and work on my house ASAP. By June 18th, I finally had drywall up and new subflooring down.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/bathroom/13.jpeg" alt="Forward progress" /></p>

<p>Come to find out, they never properly framed the walls in my shower. Plus, the original wood siding from when my bathroom was a deck remained, and instead of making things perfectly flush, they just half-did the wall (which is what that dumb shim was for that I mentioned at the beginning). My contractor had to completely reframe it all.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/bathroom/16.jpeg" alt="Forward progress" /></p>

<p>On June 26th things were looking up. He began to finish the drywall for me. June 28th brought a vanity light fixture and my flooring.</p>

<p>I spent the night of July 2nd painting my bathroom.</p>

<p>My plumbers returned to connect my toilet, vanity, and shower on July 5th. Finally, after over two months, I had a fully-functional toilet.</p>

<p>I wired my own vanity lights.</p>

<p>All that remained was getting my shower tile installed, which was easier said than done. I had to wait a couple weeks because at that point I was low on funds, but my monthly pay-day arrived and I called an friend from school to help me with the tile work.</p>

<p>Finally, after nearly five months of bathroom reno hell, I celebrated my first shower.</p>

<p>Total victory.</p>
