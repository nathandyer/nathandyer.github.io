I"¶<p>The Vocal IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign has reached its deadline and,Â unfortunately, failed to meet its goal. If you contributed to the campaign I want to personally thank you for your support. Since we set it up as a fixed funding campaign all contributors will be issued a full refund. If you have not already received a refundÂ you should be seeing your money again very soon (IndieGoGo documentation says within five days).</p>
