I"ƒ<p>Our local video rental store closed down over the summer, I was sad to learn. Iâ€™ve been going there since I was a little kid. Thatâ€™s where I first rented Star Wars on VHS. Itâ€™s where I first rented Banjo-Kazooie for the Nintendo 64. Plus, on Mondays everything was always just $1, and Iâ€™d often come home with seven or eight movies to binge. I really did love that place.</p>
