I"<p>This is just an anecdote that’s been rattling around in my brain for a couple days. Yesterday at work I met with a couple Apple representatives, including a man I had never met before who as I understand it is employed at a fairly senior level in the company. It’s always interesting to sit down and talk with the people who work at Apple, and especially with somebody at a higher position who has an ever deeper connection to upper management to get a glimpse of the internal direction within the company.</p>
