I"ñ<p>I am not a fan of full disk encryption. Thatâ€™s not to say that I donâ€™t believe there are plenty of use cases where it is prudent or useful â€” I very much do, in fact â€” but the current trend of suggesting that everyone everywhere encrypt their disks is one that I canâ€™t get behind. I understand that this is not a popular viewpoint among technologists today, and security experts everywhere shudder when they hear me say that, but over the years that opinion has solidified for me.</p>
