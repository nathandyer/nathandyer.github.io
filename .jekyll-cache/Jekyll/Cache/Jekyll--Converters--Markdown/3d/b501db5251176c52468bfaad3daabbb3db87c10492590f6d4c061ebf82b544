I"À<p>First off, I want to extend my congratulationsÂ to all theÂ elementary developers and contributors on a fantastic beta release!Â As most of you know, Vocal has been designed and developed from day one to work seamlessly with Freya. Unfortunately, that meant that it was unavailable for the majority of people to test until now (unless you were <del>impatient</del>Â determined enough toÂ ahead and build your own unofficial, franken-Freya).</p>
