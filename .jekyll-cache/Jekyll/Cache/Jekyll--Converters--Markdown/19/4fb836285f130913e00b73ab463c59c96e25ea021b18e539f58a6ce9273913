I"#<p>Although I’m happy to see a competitor to Google and Google Maps emerging in the newly announced collaboartion between <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-apple-mapkit-js/">DuckDuckGo and Apple</a>, I must admit to some disappointment to see it supplant the existing OpenStreetMaps integration. I’ve been contributing to OpenStreetMaps <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/nathandyer">off-and-on</a> for a while now. It seems to me like datasets pertaining to something as important as mapping the world ought to belong to everyone, and not one particular company. While I understand that it takes a fair amount of capital and labor to accurately map and maintain updated records of businesses and locations of interest, and such information could be a potential revenue stream for a company, it nevertheless appears to me that such information belongs to the public at large. Giving completely open access, and similarly allowing everyone to pitch in and keep the information accurate and updated, seems like the right way to go.</p>
