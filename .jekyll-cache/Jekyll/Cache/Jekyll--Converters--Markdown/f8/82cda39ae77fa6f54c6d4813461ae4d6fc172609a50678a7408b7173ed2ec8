I"»<p>Confession time: for years I was the annoying person laughing at all the people still clinging to cash to conduct their daily transactions. I just couldnâ€™t wrap my head around it. Why handle a bunch of weird, germ-infested pieces of green paper when you could much more easily just swipe a piece of plastic? Why deal with coins that merely jingle around in your pocket and inevitably fall between the couch cushions or under your driverâ€™s seat? Who in their right mind would subject themselves to this unnecessary daily hassle?</p>

<p>Over the past year, however, I have found myself switching sides. In some ways it was an automatic transitionâ€” like a local burger joint that refused to support electronic payments of any kind, or a community event where the remote and utterly disconnected location couldnâ€™t have processed a credit card transaction even if it had wanted toâ€” but in other ways it was a conscious decision. Slowly but surely, the amount of cash that I carried in my wallet increased, and all day-to-day transactions became cash-based.</p>

<p>I know youâ€™re skeptical, but letâ€™s look at some of the reasons why cash is so great:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Because companies simply cannot be trusted with our financial information.</strong> Take, for example, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/report-sonic-security-breach-could-affect-millions-2017-9">Sonic Drive-Inâ€™s recent data breach</a>. Or <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/02/fast-food-chain-arbys-acknowledges-breach/">Arbyâ€™s</a>. Or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chipotle-cyber-idUSKBN18M2BY">Chipotleâ€™s</a>. Or one of any of other dozen <a href="https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2017-data-breaches">recent high-profile breaches</a>. Itâ€™s not that the companies are necessarily incompetant (althoughâ€¦), itâ€™s just that cybersecurity is difficult.</li>
  <li><strong>Because it eliminates creepy tracking.</strong> Assuming, of course, that you donâ€™t pair it with a loyalty card or any other piece of personally identifiable information, paying with cash is anonymous and canâ€™t easily be traced back to you. Call me crazy, but I really donâ€™t want Google or other major advertisement companies getting a list of my purchases from credit card companies or banks and using it to target advertisements directly to my tastes. No, thank you.</li>
  <li><strong>For me at least, being able to hold the money in my hand makes it easier to visualize how much Iâ€™m spending.</strong> With credit cards, itâ€™s all invisible space points as far as Iâ€™m concerned. I have x number of invisible space points in the bank, and I just canâ€™t let the number hit zero. But with physical bills, which I can hold and feel and smell and see, itâ€™s clearer with every purchase I make that the amount of my money in my wallet is decreasing. So far Iâ€™ve found that it helps me spend less, and less often, but weâ€™ll see if the trend continues.</li>
  <li><strong>Because itâ€™s nice being able to just hand people money right when they need it.</strong> You hire a plumber to fix a leaky pipe, or pay a guy to come do a yearly inspection on your heat pump, or get some neighborhood kid to mow your lawn because youâ€™re too sick to bother this week. Itâ€™s nice being able to just hand them the cash directly without having to worry about security, or whether or not they have a working network connection, or if you both have the right apps installed, or payment processors taking a cut. Itâ€™s just â€œhereâ€™s your money dude, thanks a bunch.â€</li>
</ol>

<p>That said, I should point out two major things to keep in mind with cash:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Cash sucks with online shopping.</strong> You pretty much have to use a credit card (or a cryptocurrency, but that is a topic in and of itself). And I know what youâ€™re saying: â€œif you have to use your credit card online anyway, why not use it in real life, too?â€ Because at the very least youâ€™re limiting the number of places where your data could be tracked or stolen, and for another, all the reasons listed above regarding convenience and tracking spending.</li>
  <li><strong>Saving tons of cash is not a good long-term plan.</strong> When it comes to saving your money and investing it, storing it up in cash leaves it subject to inflation and at a tremendous risk due to theft or natural disasters. For long-term storage, donâ€™t use cash.</li>
</ol>

<p>Am I crazy? I donâ€™t know. But I tell you one thing, my wallet sure feels thicker.</p>
