I"ô	<p>Iâ€™ve been listening to podcasts for nearlyÂ a decade now. Theyâ€™ve kept me entertained and informed for half my life. Despite my love for podcasts, until now Iâ€™ve always beenÂ very disappointed with the podcast managers available for Linux. Many of them are just too darn clunky, bloated, unnecessarily complicated, or feature-lackingÂ toÂ use day-to-day.</p>

<p>ForÂ a while now Iâ€™ve been working on developing a new podcast app, which I have named Vocal. Itâ€™s a project thatÂ I amÂ extremely passionate about, but I didnâ€™t want to talk about it too much or make anything official prematurely.Â Iâ€™ve never coded anything this complex before. There are a lot of pieces that have to fit together just right. I didnâ€™t want to announce anything until I was sure that it would be something I could actually deliver on.</p>

<p>I am now confident that I can deliver the experience with Vocal that I have always wanted with a podcast manager on the free desktop.Â The above screenshot is from the most recentÂ build of Vocal. Itâ€™s not a mockup, thatâ€™s actual code (although the final look could, and probably will, change in some ways).</p>

<p>Right now Iâ€™m targeting it primarily for elementary OS, but once the main features are implementedÂ I am goingÂ to exploreÂ making it friendlier with other Linux distributions. elementary OS will always be the number one goal, though (at least in the near future).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s open source (GPL v3), written in Vala, and makes use of the latest functionality in Gtk 3.12.
Some features for the first release include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Video and audio podcast support</li>
  <li>Streaming and downloading</li>
  <li>Automatic checking/downloading new episodes</li>
  <li>elementary OS system integration (notifcations, launcher badges, sound menu, etc.)</li>
  <li>Importing/exportingÂ subscriptions (individual podcast feeds, as well as entire libraries).</li>
</ul>

<p>I also plan on implementing podcast discovery and one-click subscriptions for future releases. Device support may also be something I work on in the far future, but there are no official plans right now.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve not had as much time as I would like to work on it this year while at university, but this summer I hope to devote a good portion of my time to making Vocal as stable and impressive as possible. Iâ€™m expecting a first release (at least a beta) by the end of June.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates!</p>
