I"Y<p>I’m a pretty frugal guy. I don’t waste a lot of money on extraneous expenses, least of all fashion. I buy shoes once, maybe twice, a year. Every time I go shopping for shoes I always make the same remark, often to the chagrin of whichever unlucky sucker I convinced to go along with me: “welp, one pair of shoes closer to death.”</p>
