I",<p>I stumbled upon the poem ‘Eternity’ by William Blake earlier this week, and it’s been stuck in my mind ever since:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He who binds himself to a joy</p>

  <p>Does the winged life destroy</p>

  <p>He who kisses the joy as it flies</p>

  <p>Lives in eternity’s sunrise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often bind myself to various joys, usually at the cost of overall life enjoyment. I need to try and keep this tucked away in the back of my head and remember to “kiss the joy as it flies.”</p>

<p>What a lovely little poem.</p>
