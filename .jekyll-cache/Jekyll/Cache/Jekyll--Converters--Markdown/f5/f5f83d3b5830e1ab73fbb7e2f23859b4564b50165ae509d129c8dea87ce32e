I"±<p>I was sitting at a Waffle House counter about a year ago, enjoying a delicious and bountiful breakfast, when an older gentleman walked in and sat down at a very particular chair. He hadnâ€™t made his seating decision haphazardly â€” no, he knew precisely where he wanted to sit, and made a beeline for it. Pulling the chair out from the counter, the waitress said â€œmorning Frank, you want your ususal?â€</p>

<p>Just a note: it might not have been Frank. He was probably a Henry or a James, or maybe a Bob. But when I tell the story, heâ€™s Frank.</p>

<p>The man, older with wrinkles on his forehead, white hair, and a rugged disposition, just smiled and nodded his head. The waitress repeated a very precise order â€” coffee (black), two eggs over easy, hashbrowns smothered and covered, and couple sausage links. That may or may not have been his order, but again, Iâ€™m the one telling the story here.</p>

<p>And then the two conversed with each other like old friends.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s what I want. I want to be a regular somewhere. Just one of the dependable locals. Preferably at some crappy hole in the wall diner. I want to walk in to my chair, speak with my usual waitperson, and just get â€œthe usual.â€ I want that kind of intimate relationship where they know precisely the food I want to eat at any given moment, and they can make it happen with just a simple nod of the head.</p>

<p>Man oh man, I want to be a regular someplace.</p>
