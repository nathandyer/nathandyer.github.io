I"\	<p>I hesitate to put anything about this on Facebook, but I feel like I keep giving people different answers when they ask me how I’m doing, and people seem to be genuinely concerned about me, so I want to be straightforward.</p>

<p>I’m doing okay. Pretty good, actually. For those who don’t know, I was diagnosed with a rare disease (for adults anyway) called IgA vasculitis. I’m not an expert about it, but it’s a disease that affects the capiliaries and causes various issues. Most of the time it can be managed with steroids.</p>

<p>In some cases, it can cause kidney disease, which it has done for me. Two weeks ago we discovered that I had 3.5 grams of protein in my urine, which is alarming. They sent me for 1000mg IV steroids daily for a few days, and I’m on 60mg prednisone indefinitely now. Unfortunately today I found out that I’m up to 6.9 grams of protein in my urine, so things aren’t improving like they hoped. I see a local nephrologist (kidney doctor) next week, then I see two specialists at Vanderbilt near the end of the month. Right now it’s unclear what will happen but I’ll likely have to have a kidney biopsy done, just to confirm the issues are indeed caused by the IgA vasculitis (they have no reason to suspect cancer however).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, leaking that much protein causes other problems. I’m severely immunocompromised (I’ve been told my immune system is similar to that of an HIV patient), so I take an antibiotic three times a week. If you’ve noticed me avoiding crowds or staying away from schools more than normal, that’s why. I’m also at an elevated risk for a blood clot, but to be honest I’m not particularly worried about that part.</p>

<p>But for those that are worried about me, I promise — I’m doing fine. Some days I feel pretty dang good. Some days I feel a little crappy. Some days the prednisone makes me grumpier than normal, but other days it makes me feel like a million bucks. On average, I’m pretty well. I’m optimistic, I’m in good spirits, and I’m trying to go about my normal routine as much as I can running back and forth to doctor’s appointments and whatnot. Heck, I’ve even gone camping this weekend — life is good!</p>

<p>Thanks so much to everyone who has sent prayers and thoughts my way. Feel free to send more in my direction. But all in all, I’m doing just fine!</p>
