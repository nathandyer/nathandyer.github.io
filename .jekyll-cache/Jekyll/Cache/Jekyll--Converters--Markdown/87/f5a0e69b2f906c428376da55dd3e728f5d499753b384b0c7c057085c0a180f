<p>For the past two days Iâ€™ve been working on (finally) giving my office a full renovation. For reference, I posted this very blurry picture about a year ago of what my office originally looked like:
<img src="http://localhost:4000/img/office/office1.jpg" alt="" />
After that picture was taken I cleaned up a bit and painted the walls, but my office has remained like that for well over a year.

You can see that I didnâ€™t have any power up here and had to cut a hole in my living room ceiling and run an extension cord up to my office (which Iâ€™m sure is totally safe and up to code).

Before renovation began I cleared out my bookcase and emptied out as much furniture as I could.

Hereâ€™s an action shot of Dad laying down plywood. I canâ€™t thank Dad enough for giving up a Saturday and lending a hand!

Mom and Dad spreading the glue as I roll out the vinyl (thanks also to Mom!).

My desk (note: Iâ€™m getting a proper case for my desktop this week):

My newly cleared-out closet which gives me tons of extra storage space:

My bookshelf (mostly) back in working order, minus a few more books I need to carry back upstairs. At least the turntable is back up and spinning.

My new banister (still need to patch the wall and get a proper frame for my System76 poster):

My niece and nephew wanted to come check out my office and and listen to music. They approved!

I went out this morning and picked up a plastic chair mat, so I can finally sit at my computer again (apparently rolly chairs will chew up vinyl flooring). I need to add some quarter round moulding around the corners on the floor (my house isnâ€™t remotely square, so it will cover up the slight gaps that are unavoidable in certain corners), and I need to touch up a few final things, but my office is about 99% complete. I couldnâ€™t be happier!</p>
