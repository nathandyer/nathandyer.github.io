I"n<p>Generally speaking, I’m not a fan of conspiracy theories. While there certainly are people and organizations conspirating to get away with all manner of shady and unscupulous activities, I don’t think that conjuring up unfounded hypotheses is a productive way to spend your time. I also think that it ends up splitting people into different “camps” — those who believe the conspiracy and those who don’t. And worst of all, this leads to the two camps perceiving reality differently, which leads to division and an inability to agree on the facts. But I digress on that point — don’t get me started!</p>
