I"á<p>Last weekend when I went home to visit with my parents they made fun of me for walking through their door with a backpack across my shoulders, like Iâ€™ve done ever day since middle school. â€œWe thought youâ€™d outgrow it by now!â€ they told me. Itâ€™s funny that they brought it up, because my relentless habit of lugging a backpack around is something that I have been mulling over in my head on my own for a while. Truth be told, I think they touched on an insecurity.</p>
