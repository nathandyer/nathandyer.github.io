I"<p>Confession time: for years I was the annoying person laughing at all the people still clinging to cash to conduct their daily transactions. I just couldnâ€™t wrap my head around it. Why handle a bunch of weird, germ-infested pieces of green paper when you could much more easily just swipe a piece of plastic? Why deal with coins that merely jingle around in your pocket and inevitably fall between the couch cushions or under your driverâ€™s seat? Who in their right mind would subject themselves to this unnecessary daily hassle?</p>
