<p>Iâ€™ve repeatedly noticed something during my time on various adventures and excursions pretending to be a rugged outdoorsman, and I think itâ€™s time I finally commit this observation to (digital) paper: campers are, and I state this categorically without reservation, the friendliest people on the planet.</p>

<p>You are immediately welcomed into their community simply by being in or otherwise geographically adjacent to a campsite. Whether youâ€™re staying in a motorhome, a tent, or the trunk of a rusted-out Camry, merely being there and being a part of the experience grants you full privilege to the community.</p>

<p>As people walk along by your campsite, they all invariably smile at you, wave, and maybe even give you a â€œhow yaâ€™ doinâ€™?â€ On early morning walks you almost always get some comments about the weather by the people you pass. â€œGeez, itâ€™s a bit chilly this morning, huh?â€ â€œWell I was camping over in Colorado three weeks ago, you just <em>think</em> it is chilly this morning! I froze my balls off!â€</p>

<p>If you have a question, you can literally walk over to anyoneâ€™s campsite and just ask it. Theyâ€™ll answer you, offer you something to eat, and part ways with you by extending a greeting like â€œhappy camping!â€ Yes, itâ€™s a dorky thing to say, but God help me I love it when people tell me â€œhappy camping.â€</p>

<p>And itâ€™s not just friendliness, itâ€™s also pure, unquestioned trust and belief in your fellow person. I have about a thousand bucks worth of stuff in my tent on any given camping trip. Power converters, air mattresses and pumps, cooking accessories, laptops, you name it. Do I lock it? No, of course not â€” itâ€™s made out of cloth! Any bozo wanting to rob me blind need only use a knife or scissors. What good would a lock do?</p>

<p>But even if the tent were an inpetetrable fortress of solitude, a lock would <em>still</em> be entirely unnecessary. People leave other peoplesâ€™ stuff alone. They donâ€™t mess with things that arenâ€™t theirs. It just ainâ€™t right â€” so they donâ€™t do it. No other reason or explanation is needed.</p>

<p>Plus, people who camp are willing to share. Need some matches? Here, take mine. Need some more charcoal? Hell, I canâ€™t use all of this! More firewood? Here are a few pieces I canâ€™t burn, go nuts.</p>

<p>One of the things I like so much about the open source community is how well the people who actually work on it get along, and how easily newcomers are accepted. But campers? Itâ€™s a whole â€˜nother thing. Iâ€™m not sure a happier, more laid-back, welcoming group of people exists on the planet. If they do, I sure would like to meet them.</p>
