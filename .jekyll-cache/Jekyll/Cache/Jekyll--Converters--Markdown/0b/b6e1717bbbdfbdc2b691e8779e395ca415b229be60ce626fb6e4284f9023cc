I"¢<p>Iâ€™m a sucker for great stuff. Good tools, rugged materials, reliable designs, and objects that are just plain pleasurable to use. My quest to seek out things that meet these criteria has often left me looking for things that could be labeled as â€œthe best.â€ This has led to me obtaining some really nice stuff, but Iâ€™ve come to realize that it has also created a lot of unnecessary heartache in my life.</p>
