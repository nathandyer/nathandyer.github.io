I was conflicted about featuring OpenDNS, simply because I felt I would be using the term “software” a little too loosely, but I came to the decision that web apps are indeed considered software. Regardless of how you classify it, OpenDNS is an amazing service and network management system.

The first place to start in this post is describing what DNS is. A Domain Name Server is sort of like a phone-book for the internet. When you type the name of a website into the URL bar it first goes to a DNS and looks up what you’ve entered, finds the match and where it leads, and then connects you like a telephone operator.  Chances are, you’re using the DNS that your ISP provides for you. But here’s the thing: there’s an amazingly powerful open-source alternative that lets you manage your network meticulously and can even speed up your web browsing experience.

I won’t bog down this post with installation instructions; OpenDNS will walk you through that once you’re registered. It does involve a few tweaks with your router, so be prepared for that. As always, if you need any help whatsoever I will be more than happy to help (twitter.com/ossftw, ossforthewin@gmail.com).

It starts with you signing up for an account. OpenDNS is free, but there is a premium version if you’re interested. Sign up, follow the installation instructions, and viola- you’re finished. From there you can begin to filter content on your network, view detailed stats, monitor network usage. You can block certain domains and types of domains. Porn a problem? Block it. Kids downloading stuff on BitTorrent? You can even block that, too. It's all in your control. Plus, if you're a network administrator, you can rejoice in the fact that it warns you when malware is detected. If your employees keep getting viruses on their machines you can see exactly where they got it and what they did, which makes fixing the problem even easier. You can view activity over time, see which sites users are visiting, and even get a list of the blocked domains people are trying to access.

There's nothing to elaborate on this topic, but sometimes using OpenDNS can speed up the time it takes to load a page, because it can be faster than the DNS server your ISP uses. It doesn't take as long to get to your destination if you can find the map faster.

Another selling point: you can manage multiple networks with just one account from any location. It's like the one ring to rule them all.

Really, there's little more I can say. For a better web experience for home users, OpenDNS is the answer. For detailed network stats and monitoring, and advanced security and blocking features, OpenDNS is a no-brainer. Plus, you're supporting open standards.
