Okay, I’ve just had an epiphany, and I want to know if I’m alone in this. My entire life I’ve used the pre-prepped bun method: put the ketchup on the bun, the bun on the burger, and then consume. But is this very economical? How do you ensure the right ketchup distribution throughout the patty? If you have several items in need of ketchup, is there a better way to accommodate all the items in need of the sweet, tomato-y condiment?
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.neontommy.com/sites/default/files/users/user431/fries.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Fries (Creative Commons, see http://www.neontommy.com/)" src="http://www.neontommy.com/sites/default/files/users/user431/fries.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
Enter the dipping method. Make a lake of ketchup, dip everything in it- including the burger. You don’t have to take time to partition the sauce, and you always get just the right amount because it’s on the outside of the bun, instead of hiding out underneath.

Am I crazy? <img src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1336659725g" alt=":)" />
