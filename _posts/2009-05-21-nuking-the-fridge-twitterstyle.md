 Nuke the Fridge (New-ke the fr-id-ge) V. When something terrific reaches a point where it goes from simply amazing to utterfly pitiful, derrived from the film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," where one of the most amazing series ever becomes unbelievable, ridiculous, and difficult to watch.

Twitter is the thing that everyone is talking about. Before, only the unusually geeky knew about the social networking site, and even fewer used it. Now, everyone can't stop talking about it. That's good, right?

No. Wrong.

When I say this, many people think that I'm trying to imply that not everyone should be able to use it; only the geeky. This isn't the case at all. Twitter is a wonderful service that everyone should get the chance to use and enjoy, but the fact is, many people are using it for the wrong reason.

Twitter is what's called a "Micro-blogging" site. It's meant to send out short bursts of information, like what you're doing, interesting links, funny quotes- etc. People that joined Twitter in the past used it for that reason, as well as seeing what other people enjoy posting.

It quickly became a popularity contest, which angered me greatly. The entire "Ashton Kutcher" thing made me growl a little. It doesn't matter how many followers you have, it just matters that you're there for the right reason. Don't use it as a measure of how popular you are or to prove you're more popular than someone else.

Then Oprah joined. She doesn't follow hardly anyone, but thousands joined simply because she did, only to follow her. I wish that each of those accounts would simply delete themselves. This isn't what Twitter is about, and that made me angriest of all.

And if you don't understand it at all, either find more about it, or don't join. Twitter is not an instant message client. It bugs me to no end to see people @replying to people as messages. If you want to comment, or send a little message, that's fine; that's what the system was designed for, in fact. But don't use 300 tweets to talk to you friend about what you had last night for dinner and discuss the complexity of homework for that day.

All that aside, Twitter is a wonderful service. If you're serious about joining, you really should. It's interesting and, most of all, it's fun. More users only makes it better! Just Tweet for the right reasons.
