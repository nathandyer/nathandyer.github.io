<p>If you use Midori, you've probably noticed by now that Flash support is pretty much non-existent. Although Flash is a proprietary and resource-intensive plug-in, many sites rely on it to deliver content like games and videos. &nbsp;Fear not, you can still watch YouTube videos via the HTML5 player. Although by default not all clips are available to watch using the HTML5 player, with very little effort you can have a smoother experience than ever before.</p><p></p><p><strong>1. Enable User Addons in Midori. </strong>Go to Gear Menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Extensions, and check the box beside 'User addons'.</p><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/screenshot20from202013-07-1220190403.png" /><p><strong>2. Join the HTML5 trial on YouTube.</strong> Visit <a href="http://youtube.com/html5" target="_blank">http://youtube.com/html5</a> and click the button to 'Join the HTML5 Trial'.</p><p></p><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/screenshot20from202013-07-1920231059.png" /><p><strong>3. Install the 'YouTube Center' User Script.</strong> <a href="https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/114002" target="_blank">Click here to be taken to the Userscripts.org page for YouTube Center.</a> A blue bar should appear at the top of the page asking if you'd like to install the user script. Click 'Install user script'.&nbsp;</p><p></p><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/screenshot20from202013-07-1220190530.png" /><p>That's it! Now, you can browse YouTube normally and videos will play exactly like you would expect. Videos are played back using YouTube's HTML5 player, which uses open web standards that Midori is fully compliant with.&nbsp;</p><p>And, should you wish, you will also notice that video download links are listed on the YouTube video pages. This makes it easy to save them for later viewing or archival.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
