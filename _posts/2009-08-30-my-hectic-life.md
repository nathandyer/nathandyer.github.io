It’s been a long while since I’ve posted, so I suppose I have quite a lot to write about today. Since my last post, things have sped up drastically, but I’m finally getting things back to the right tempo. The fall semester started, so I had to get back into the normal swing of things. On top of that, my grandmother has been needing surgery, so that’s kept me on my toes. But now, I’m nestled in, she’s fine, and everything can start being normal again.

Nothing much has changed since my last post. The only movie I saw was ‘Knowing,’ and I’m not sure if I liked it or not. It was like I watched two movies at once, one being amazed and the other sucking. I haven’t really done anything exciting at all.

I can brag on two things, however. First off, I finally got into working with the VLC player, and I can’t be happier. I had tried it long ago, but I found it to be too cluttered and unusable. After realizing I can skin it, I’ve found it to be the best video player I’ve ever used. Any player that I can crop a 4:3 to a 16:9 instead of just stretching it, I’m all for it. And finally, I can play the HD versions of podcasts!

I also want to report that paper books are officially dead. I called it. Sitting in the waiting room at the hospital for 8 hours with nothing to do, I pull out my iPod, and open my Kindle app. I’ve had it on there, but I haven’t really used it much. After a quick minute of shopping, I found one of my favorite books available for free. I “purchased” it, and almost instantly it downloaded and I began to read. No carbon footprint, instant, and cheap. Yeah, you can kiss your beloved paperback good-bye.

But, that’s all I have to say for now. Until next time, live long and prosper. . \\ //
