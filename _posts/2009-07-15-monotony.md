Monotony is my biggest problem. No matter what it is, no matter how much I strive to mix things up, I always find myself stuck in the exact same cycle doing the exact same things. The truth is, I think that human beings are programmed to get a routine going and just stick with it.

But that's a bad thing. Variety is the spice of life.  I think one of the best ways for us to do better in anything is to simply do what we can to break the monotony. I didn't realize how much everything I do is  the exact same until recently. Every day I would get up, I would catch up on the same podcasts, watch the same TV shows, eat the same food, and live the same day over and over and over. But, I'm done with that. I'm mixing things up, and it feels great. I'm checking out new things, throwing in a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch every now and then, and even going without my computer for short bursts of time. And you know what? It feels great.

So <span style="color:#993300;">I DARE you</span> to try to do something different. It's completely funtastic. Heck, to further show that I'm supporting myself, I'm going to finish this blog post <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>differently.</em></span>

But, to bring it back in just a little bit:
