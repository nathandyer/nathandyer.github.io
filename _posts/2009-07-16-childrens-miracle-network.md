Well, guys, it's happening. I'm packing my toothbrush and heading to a place unlike 99% of the others I go to: an internet dead zone. That's right, guys. Try to image it: no Tweets, no Facebook, no blogging, not even a few new podcasts.

But, before I go, I think it's a great time to tell you (if you haven't already seen it) about the SocialVibe widget I have on my blog. Sometimes people have great ideas that are so wonderful you go, "Holy crap." That's especially true when it helps someone else.  With the SocialVibe widget, my blog is helping to benefit the Children's Miracle Network. If you click on the widget you will be given a video to watch and will be asked to rate the video. When you rate the commercial for Sprint, my blog's sponsor, they will donate money to the Children's Miracle Network. So far, the impact on my blog is 750 balloons. I'd <span style="color:#ff0000;">LOVE </span>for you to head over to my blog (nathandyer.wordpress.com for those reading the Facebook or RSS feed) and help everyone out! CMN's goal is to raise $750,000.

Thanks! I wish you all a great two days in my absence.

Play me off keyboard cat! As always,

Nathan
