title: Wireless Charging
---

I must admit I was wrong about something (among many other things): wireless charging is amazing.

When I first heard about it I made fun of the idea. Who is so lazy that they can't be bothered to plug in their phones for a few minutes to let it recharge? 

But then I got a new phone that supported wireless charging, and for the sake of satisfying my curiosity I purchased a wireless charger. It's such a simple little thing (and inexpensive too), but it has genuinely improved my life in a small but measurable way. I used to let my phone get as close to the brink of death as possible, but now whenever I'm lounging in bed or working at my desk I just naturally set it down on the little cradle. I don't have to physically think about doing anything (other than making sure it's in the right spot), and with just that one little change suddenly my phone is always charged. To paraphrase Forest Gump, that's one less thing I have to think about. 

And sure, I know that it's slower than wired charging, but the fact is it doesn't matter because my phone is just always charged and I never have to think about it.

So I was wrong. Sometimes the little life improvements add up.
