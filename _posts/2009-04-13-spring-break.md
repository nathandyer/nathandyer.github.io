After weeks of nonstop due dates and exhausting assignments, I have finally reached Spring Break. The break consists of only four days, including the weekend that I would have gotten anyway, but I am still thankful. The truth is, I was worn out and I couldn't have continued without a break. I felt like I was getting behind in everything. It was like no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get head. I was discouraged, I no longer cared about things, and waking up each day was a new curse. But now, everything is fine. I feel well-rested, I'm on top of everything, I'm caught up, and I can honestly say that I don't mind going in Tuesday. I feel... free. Like I've been unplugged. I can't describe it- I haven't felt like this is a while.<br /><br />Actually, free sums it up very well. I've been unplugged from the Matrix.<br /><br />So, that's my update for this amazing weekend, filled with the Matrix, Rain, Banana Pudding, and hours of Twilight and Munchcast. It's 11:40 PM, I never stay up this late, and I feel stoned, so I'm gonna split.<br /><br />MTFBWU<br /><br />As Always,<br />Nathan
