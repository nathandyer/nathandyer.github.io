In my opinion, Google Chrome is the very best browser in the world. It's lightweight, powerful, and unbelievably fast. It was the first browser to separate the different elements into individual processes, so that if something crashes inside the browser you won't lose everything. This was brilliant engineering back when it was released, and set a trend for all upcoming browsers to follow.

Google played their hand very smart during the whole thing. Originally, the browser was Windows-only, but Google wasted little time in open-sourcing the code in a project called <em>Chromium</em> in order to efficiently port it over to both Mac and Linux.

There are many other great features that I failed to mention. In addition to the HTML5 features, Chrome has started shipping with Adobe Flash built right in. While no one really likes it, because it's so hoggish and proprietary, we all know how much of a necessary evil it is. The ugly menu options are all inside of an icon to the right, clearing up space and preventing clutter (this is obviously not the case for the Mac OS X version, as the menu is built in). The tabs are easy to arrange, and can be dragged out into new windows with the slide of the mouse. The extensions are numerous in quantity, and unmatched in quality (IMO, your mileage may vary).

While I support both Chrome and Chromium (because they're nearly identical), it is important to note that Chromium is the entirely open source version of the two. If you want more speed, reliability, and ease of use, run- don't walk- and pick up a copy.
