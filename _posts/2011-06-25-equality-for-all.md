<a href="http://i.imgur.com/xdxkh.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Empire State Building" src="http://i.imgur.com/xdxkh.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="448" /></a>I wanted to take a minute to just say congratulations to the State of New York.

I have faith that one day the government will be more faithful to the people over which it serves, and will one day be unbiased to the simple idea on which America was founded: equality for all.

To quote <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JustinRYoung" target="_blank">JustinRYoung </a>on Twitter: "Congrats to the New York State Senate for doing something on time and effective."

And congratulations to those personally affected by the new legislation. I wish you all the best.
