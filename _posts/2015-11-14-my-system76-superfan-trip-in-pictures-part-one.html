<p>I am halfway though a remarkable trip to Denver, Colorado, thanks to the incredibly generous folks at <a href="http://system76.com" target="_blank">System76</a>. I'll write a more in-depth post about what all went down, but for now I just want to share some videos and pictures to give you an idea of some of the amazing things I've experienced and some of the outstanding people I've had the pleasure of meeting over the past couple days.</p>

<p>This is a clip I captured of us walking into System76 for the first time (sorry for the vertical vid!). Kate and Carl greeted us at the door and threw sparkles (glitter? confetti? eh, sparkles is a good enough word). Also in the video: my first IRL interaction with Cassidy, a long-time friend (I'm currently writing this from his guest bedroom. Big thanks to him and his wife, Katie, for letting me do Airbnb and crash at their place for a few extra days!)</p>

You can make mountains, volcanoes, and even summon a rain storm just by holding out your hands.[/caption]</p>

We stayed at the Brown Palace Hotel and Spa, which I think looks a lot like the Titanic (pre-sinking, of course). Every U.S. President has stayed here except for Obama. Words can hardly describe how grandiose it was.[/caption]</p>
