<p>After peering at my clock a single thought popped into my head: well, it’s almost over. But really, when you think about it, it’s just begun. As of right now we have a little more than thirteen hours left of the Bush Administration. This is a huge night, really, although many people don’t realize that. Bush has been president for the majority of my life, the only one other than Clinton, who I don’t really remember at all. </p>  <p>So, my thoughts? About darn time. After eight years of the same thing I am ready for a change, whether for better or worse. </p>  <p>So tonight I raise my glass in a toast: here’s to the future. Good-bye, Bush, and hello President Obama. </p>  <p>“Change begins when we believe / in a brighter day a better way to succeed / together we can make it better you and me / so we can be safe and prosperous and free…” <u>Vote for Hope,&#160;&#160; M.C.
