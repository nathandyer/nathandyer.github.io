* Up and at em
* Email
* Went shopping with Mom
* Spent the afternoon hanging new artwork in my house
* Worked on Vocal
	* Separated the play and pause functionalilty into two distinct methods to fix the problem caused by Vocal's MPRIS implementation where it would start playing episodes after unplugging headphones or disconnecting from a Bluetooth headset
	* Improved the look of the iTunes store results in both the top 100 podcasts and search results views
	* Did a one-liner to switch to webkit2gtk-4.0
* More email
* Will finish the evening by messing around with my blog
