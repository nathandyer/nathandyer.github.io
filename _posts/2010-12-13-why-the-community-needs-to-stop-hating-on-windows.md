<p>For as long as I can remember, people have been passionate about flaming their &#8220;nerd turf wars.&#8221; You have Windows fans on one side calling Mac users fanboys and hipsters, and you have Mac users calling Windows users stupid and inelegant. Then, of course, you have the Linux guys saying that Microsoft and Apple are evil, and Macs are over-priced for the hardware.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a post about which is better. The truth of the matter is that, no matter which operating system you prefer, someone out there prefers another one than you. You can&#8217;t declare someone&#8217;s choice better or worse than anyone else&#8217;s. Everyone is unique, and we need to appreciate that.</p>
<p>Because, let&#8217;s face it, Windows is still a &#8220;necessary evil&#8221; (I&#8217;m using that term as an expression. By no means do I think that Windows, or Microsoft for that matter, is evil). WIndows is necessary for playing games (come on, guys, have you <em>used</em> Steam? It&#8217;s amazing!), watching Netflix, and doing many other media-related tasks that Linux users otherwise can&#8217;t do. And the truth is, Windows isn&#8217;t that bad. The Windows 7 interface is polished, and the user experience is better than ever. Sure, we might not like it as much, or feel as passionate about using it, but it&#8217;s about time to understand that Windows isn&#8217;t bad, and neither are the people that choose to use it. We need to appreciate that Windows opens up the largest possible market for developers to distribute their open-source software. Windows is beneficial to the community, and we need to stop dissing it at ever possible opportunity.</p>
