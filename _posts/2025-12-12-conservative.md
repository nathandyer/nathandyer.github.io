title: If the World Made Sense, I Would Call Myself a Conservative
summary: You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.

If the world made any sense, I would call myself a conservative. 

I believe we only have one home planet, and that we should try to conserve its resources and live as sustainably as possible so that we can have the freshest water, the cleanest air, the most hospitable climate, and the most nutritious food for as long as possible. That we should conserve every ounce of energy that we receive from the sun, and leave the carbon that we have buried in the ground in the same place it has been for millions of years.

I believe that there are a finite amount of resources in the world, and we should conserve them for people so they can live healthy, enjoyable lives. I don't believe one human life is more valuable than other, and everyone has a right to the basic necessities.

I believe that there is a finite amount of time available in a human life, and that we shouldn't have to use it arguing with insurance companies and fighting to receive the care we need. I also don't believe anyone should have to waste the one life they have in fighting against other humans with equally precious lives, especially over trivial things like lines on a map.

I believe that money is also a limited resource (or at least, the best tool we have for representing the finite resources that we all must share), and should be spent on things that improve the lives of the people. It should go towards raising the standard of living, and helping people life healthy, happy, prosperous lives. Every unnecessary purchase is fighting against that goal.

But I don't live in a world that makes sense. I live in a world where the people who are the most "conservative" are the ones conserving the least. They don't want to conserve, they want to regress. In this silly world I am a "radical", I am "unrealistic," I am "naive."

That may be, but you wouldn't believe how well I sleep at night.
