Note: I'm blatantly ripping off [the thing that Michael Meeks has been doing](https://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/) for years where he writes down what he does each day. I'm going to make an  attempt to do this every single day in an effort to increase my productivity by publicly shaming myself. We'll see how well I actually do. Please note, however, that as of right now I am still a college student and work at least 3 days per week at a job in IT, and am NOT a full-time software developer.

* Up and at em
* Email
* Work (confirmed a problem and solution that I have been chasing for weeks now!)
* Off work early due to homecoming
* Grocery shopping
* Spent a couple hours editing a video to show the coding club students on Monday
* Fixed the ugly toolbar on the episode pane in Vocal
* Fixed the alignment of several labels which were driving me bonkers
* Made the search popover in Vocal much, much more responsive
* Ending the day by reading more in Ron Chernow's _Hamilton_
