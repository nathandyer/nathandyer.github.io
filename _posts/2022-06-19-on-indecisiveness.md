title: On Indecisiveness

I’ve recently identified a struggle with being indecisive.

Indecisiveness is one of those things that, on the surface, seems relatively minor, but when left unchecked it can sneak and place and leave you with a burdensome sense of being paralyzed by choice.

I’d like to say that I came to this realization on my own, but it was my girlfriend that pointed it out to me. She absolutely hates to make decisions, as doing so stresses her out. She explained to me that one of her favorite things about me when we first stated dating was that I was able to make a decision and stick with it, but lately she has noticed that I seem to hem and haw over every little detail and every fork in the road.

Since then, I’ve made an effort to be more decisive. No more “I don’t know, what do _you_ feel like eating,” no more “I don’t know, what do _you_ want to do."

While I have not done a perfect job of making immediate decisions since making that realization, I have made considerable improvements, and generally notice both clarify of mind and increased peacefulness from not wasting too much time or too many mental cycles just trying to make the most basic (and relatively inconsequential) decisions. 

Big decisions are worth thought and deliberation, but for the “small stuff,” I highly recommend working towards stamping out indecision as much as possible.
