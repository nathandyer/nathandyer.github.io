title: Is There Anybody Out There?
summary: I'm curious if anyone is actually reading these posts
---

I don't have any analytics on this site, but I _do_ use Cloudflare (I know, I know), and while I was in the admin panel recently I noticed that there are some traffic stats that I haven't really paid attention to before. I was surprised to see hundreds of unique visitors in the span of just a day or two, although I know that the vast majority of those unique visitors are probably just various AI bots scraping everything I write to assimilate into some giant corpus.

I write a fair number of blog posts (especially in recent years/months), but I usually do it out of the assumption that I'm the only one really reading it. I tend to think of this more as a journal (albeit one where extremely personal information is omitted), with perhaps one or two people reading it. But the thought that there may be way more than that is equal parts surprising, terrifying, and exciting.

So I'm curious: how many humans are actually out there reading this?

If you are a regular reader, or even just someone looking at this post, I'd love to get an email from you, even if it's just an empty message with a subject like "I read your post." As usual, I'm at nathandyer [at] fastmail [dot] com.
