<p>Today has been one of those days- you know what I’m talking about. Things have turned out for the worse, bad things happened, and many changes were made.</p>  <p>It’s kind of silly, but after seeing some other posts on the BOL Forum, I decided to do something similar. Then, after hearing about Steve Jobs, it seemed like I must.</p>  <p>Molly, after hearing the announcement that you would be stepping away from the post of full-time BOL host I was bummed, but I completely understand. I am looking forward to Mad Molly Monday’s. I am positive that Buzz Out Loud will still be an amazing show, and Natali will do a great job, but it still will not be the same. I wish you the best of luck at the other things you’re trying to pursue! I hope that the Buzz Report turns out like you’re hoping, because it will be great! On a final note, though, JaNaTo sounds weird. Maybe it should be JaToNa. Either way, it’s not the same as JaMoTo. </p>  <p>Steve, I was sad to hear that you were going to take a small break from Apple, but I can’t say I didn’t understand or somewhat expect it. We’ll miss you while you’re gone, but I’m sure that June will come quickly and things will be back to the way they were. I wish you a speedy and healthy recovery.</p>  <p>I guess things just have to change, but danggit I was getting used to the way they were. I suppose nothing says the same forever. Best of luck to everyone! To lighten to mood “In these troubling economic times”- now DRINK! Haha</p>
