It's sometimes hard for me to balance what I post on this blog. Most of the time I end up writing something about technology, even though I often say that I am going to talk about something different. The fact of the matter is, I usually find tech-related things much more interesting than anything I have going on in my life. Because, frankly, there just isn't much going on.

But, there are some things I'm involved in worth writing about, or I think so at least. For instance, I'm really getting into the full swing of driving, and because of this I've noticed a few things. So, in my spare time, I did what any other blogger my age would do: I came up with a list of laws that should be either added or removed.

<strong>#1) The ability to pass a car on a double-yellow line if the vehicle in front of you is going 15 or more mph less than the speed limit and the other lane is clear. </strong>That's pretty much self-explanatory.

<strong>#2) If someone rides your bumper you should be allowed to hit them. </strong>If you're crawling, it's fine. But when you're driving the speed limit, that's just insane. They're just being a jerk. Period.

<strong>#3) Speed-limit-ranges. </strong>That's right. Do away with the whole "top speed" thing, because, honestly, it's hard to maintain 55 mph when everyone else is going 60. And sometimes, after a hill, you pick up speed. It's not your fault- it's gravity's.

<strong>#4) Minimum 1-year jail sentence for people who text while driving. </strong>I like technology as much (or more) as the next guy, but there's a time and place for everything.

and, I know this isn't really traffic related at all, but:

<strong>#5) Public tobacco ban. </strong>Smoke is terrible. I get choked up and I find it repulsive. Not to mention smokeless tobacco. Perhaps it's not as bad as breathing in carcinogenic smoke, but watching people spit black goo everywhere isn't any fun either.

As always,
