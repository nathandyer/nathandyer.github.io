I was bored tonight, so I did what any other geeky person would do: I went through my entire DVD library to see which ones stood up to a 1920x1080 resolution display. The results were very surprising.

<strong><span style="font-size:medium;">The Best</span></strong>

<a href="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image.png"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;border-top:0;margin-right:auto;border-right:0;" title="image" src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image_thumb.png" border="0" alt="image" width="64" height="88" /></a>

The best DVD, hands down, was the <em>Lion King</em> Platinum Edition. The picture quality was simply stunning and the “all-new 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix” blew me away. It kicked Dolby’s butt, hands-down.

A close second was the Collector’s Edition<em> Finding Nemo</em>. The picture was nearly flawless in most scenes, but in a few I stopped to scratch my head. For instance, when Marlin and Nemo are first in their anemone it loses so much clarity.

And finally, <em>Star Wars</em> Episodes IV-VI (even though the first three never happened) were wonderfully restored. Of course, you know that Star Wars films are going to be THX’d to the max!

<strong><span style="font-size:medium;">The Good</span></strong>

<a href="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image1.png"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;border-top:0;margin-right:auto;border-right:0;" title="image" src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image_thumb1.png" border="0" alt="image" width="62" height="86" /></a>

There seems to be a sweet spot that many of my movies found. They didn’t stick out in my mind above the rest, but they looked and sounded dang good. Such titles: <em>Shrek 3,</em> <em>Elf</em>, <em>Second-Hand Lions,</em> and even <em>Christmas Vacation</em> looked decent for its age.

<strong><span style="font-size:medium;">The Butt-Ugly</span></strong>

<a href="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image2.png"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;border-top:0;margin-right:auto;border-right:0;" title="image" src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image_thumb2.png" border="0" alt="image" width="58" height="84" /></a>

The absolutely most disappointing, completely unsuspected failure was the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Trilogy. They are all filmed so beautifully, yet when thrown up to an HD screen, you want to vomit. I was completely underwhelmed, though the audio track is still spectacular.

To be such a recent film, “<em>Dude, Where’s My Car?”</em> was pathetic. I don’t know what more to add to that, but it’s true.

The #1 worst-looking film in my collection, aside from the <em>Andy Griffith</em> show on DVD (not that it’s their fault), was <em>Ghostbusters</em>. Sure, it’s kind of old, but you’d think a film like that would deserve at least a small attempt at a restoration. Fail.
