The first public development release of Vocal is now available!

Please keep in mind that this is a preview release. Vocal is still a work in progress. You should only use it at this point if you are comfortable running into unexpected problems and crashes.

That warning aside, I have been using it for a while now and I believe that it is starting to feel fairly stable. Your mileage may vary (and if it does, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/vocal" target="_blank">please let me know</a>).

Most of the features of the final release are implemented in this beta, with the only major exception being embedded video support.You can manage video podcasts, and technically you <em>can</em> play them in Vocal, but the experience is not what I want it to be yet. Proper video playback will be added over the next few weeks and <strong>will</strong><em> </em>be included in the 1.0 release, following a period of additional testing and bug fixing.

If you're brave enough to give it a go you can add the daily (unstable) PPA by entering the below commands into a terminal:
<pre>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:nathandyer/vocal-daily
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vocal</pre>
Vocal will only work on elementary OS Freya.* <strong>The best course of action is to wait until the Freya Beta is released before trying out Vocal.</strong> For the impatient among you, however, you should be able to run it either on a copy of Freya you have built yourself, or on Ubuntu Trusy or Utopic after installing elementary-desktop from the elementary Daily PPA.
