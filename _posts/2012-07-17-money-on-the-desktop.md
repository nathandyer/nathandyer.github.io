File this one under "problems I didn't even know I needed solved." Today <a href="http://mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint</a>, the popular financial website that lets users easily keep track of all their money, released an app for Mac OS called "Mint QuickView."

I absolutely love everything about it, from the initial concept to the final execution. I'll be the first to admit that I am of the fiscally irresponsible, spoiled Internet generation that will not, under any circumstances, balance a checkbook. And, by that, I mean I don't even own one (and haven't since I got one from opening a checking account when I was like 8 years old). I tell myself that I'll just look over everything later after it shows up on Mint (which is a complete lie, because I'm almost always too busy or too lazy).

Which is why, all too often, I pull up Mint or make a deposit and immediately have the, "holy cow, where'd all the money go?!?" experience. The one where you say "did someone overcharge me? Did someone charge me twice?," and then realize three seconds later after viewing the purchases that the money <strong>probably disappeared somewhere around the 20th Big Mac.</strong>

But I digress. The point of this being:<strong> I would love to have all my financial information (recent purchases, current amount that I have, etc.) a millisecond away on my desktop, so that I could always keep up-to-date with my spending.</strong>

Which brings me to the point of writing this: <strong>I would <em>love </em>Mint forever if they would create a Linux version.</strong>

Just imagine if they made an app for us. They could integrate it with the Ubuntu desktop by having Unity launcher integration (showing number of recent purchases), an indicator, and maybe even notifications that read something like "You probably can't afford chicken fajitas tonight, fatty, stick with Ramen."

So, Mint:
