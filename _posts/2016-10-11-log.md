* Up and at em at 7:00
* Morning social media catchup and reading
* Read _Alexander Hamilton_ for 5 hours so I could finally finish that giant book
* Studied physics for 3 hours
* Connected the "mark episode as played" button in Vocal (and subsequently found a huge bug related to that whole system)
* Visited with my niece and nephews
