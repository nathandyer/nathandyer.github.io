title: "Here's to Aaron Swartz"

I'd come across the name Aaron Swartz across the Internet several times through the years. As someone concerned with freedom of information, open exchange of ideas, digital freedom, and free software, his name often appeared in my streams.

I was very sad to hear the news that he took his life Friday, Jan 11. I'm sorry to say that I didn't take the time to learn more about him while he was alive, but after reading up on him recently, I feel as though we share many of the same core values and ideas. I send my sincere condolences to the family, and I wish for Aaron to rest in peace. He managed to make a big difference, and will certainly be missed.

As a very small token of gratitude I made an extra donation to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://eff.org), and I would highly encourage you to do the same.
