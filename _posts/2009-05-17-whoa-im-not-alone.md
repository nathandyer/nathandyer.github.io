I'd say that it's been rainy for a while, but that's an understatement. Pouring rain and thunder has kept me inside for a while (not that sun would've really changed that), and, in that time, I've been able to simply sit down and relax.

The past week for me has been extrememly hectic, and I have  no idea why. I suppose everything's been the same, I guess, but something feels extremely different. I slipped by an entire week with my podcatcher filling up and my Hulu queue reaching nearly 15 unwatched episodes.

So, as you've guessed, I've been hard at work getting caught up with everything again. While listening to podcasts (particularaly The Tech Guy), I've been surfing the web quite a lot, Digging stories and tweeting. I hadn't posted in a while, mainly because I've been busy and nothing awesome or new has happened (nor has anyone really angered me recently), but I decided that I needed to post something. I signed into my Wordpress blog, went to my dashboard, and that's when I saw it- I actually have readers! Many days I got between 6 and 9 views! Now, for many bloggers, that number is terrible, but when you're an unknown Jo-schmo that thinks he pretty much just talking to himself, that's a big number. Especially when you're used to getting at most 2 a week. So, everyone, thanks for a big surprise. I now feel like I'm not wasting my time.

On another, non-egotistical note I went to see the new Star Trek movie. I was blown away. Sure, it was as Treky as ever, but I thought J.J. Abrams did a superb job (my Lost fanboy-ness is showing). The acting was great, the story line was immaculate, and the actual script itself was nearly flawless. I'm not really a Trek fan (A geek that doesn't like Star Trek? I know. I'm thinking it too), but I must say, this was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. People that know me and ever read anything I review know I'm a tough guy- I don't give many 5-star ratings. I still can't give this one a perfect score, but it deserves a 4.5 ratings hands-down. I'm sorry, no film like that can ever top Serenity- unless Joss Whedon finally made a sequel.

Well, that's my $.02.

As always,

Nathan
