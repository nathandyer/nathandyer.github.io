After a week of experience with Maverick, I can say a few things, the main being that it doesn't require a multiple-post review. I asked the question, is it a breakthrough, or just a little polish?

It's like a super-polish. They took Maverick, improved what could be improved, and set in place new upgrades and technologies. I'll quickly do a recap of some of the most important ones that I've failed to cover:

<strong>1) <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/08/multi-touch-comes-to-ubuntu-10-10/" target="_blank">Multi-touch from the get-go</a>, as well as native support for <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/benjamin-gets-his-hands-on-the-apple-magic-trackpad/" target="_blank">Apple's Magic Trackpad</a> (thanks to the latest Linux Kernel).</strong>

<strong>2) <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/09/20/announcing-the-ubuntu-application-review-process/" target="_blank">A system for developers to get their content into the Software Center</a> (which I have some problems with, but I'll rant on a later post. <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/ubuntu-application-review-process-announced-restrictive-rules-galore/" target="_blank">This OMG!Ubuntu! post sums up a lot of what I think</a>)</strong>

<strong>3) F-Spot replaced with Shotwell (which I'll review later)</strong>

<strong>4) MUCH BETTER Ubuntu One, with more stability and a better user experience, as well as a very appealing pricing structure.</strong>

<strong>5) <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/08/snails-dalmatians-plenty-of-grass-its-ubuntu-10-10s-new-wallpapers-download/" target="_blank">New community wallpapers</a></strong>

<strong>6) Unity for Netbook installs (which I found to be slow and unusable)</strong>

<strong>7) New, colorful-er calculator.</strong>

<strong>8 ) Updated version of Gwibber, which supports the new OAuth.</strong>

Maverick is so cozy I feel right at home, and have since I installed it. It matches how I think. In collaboration with the sound menu and the new software center, I feel like my entire computing experience is simplified and perfected. It's a great set of upgrades that puts a nice polish where you need it. It's it revolutionary? No. But I whole-hearedly recommend downloading it any way.
