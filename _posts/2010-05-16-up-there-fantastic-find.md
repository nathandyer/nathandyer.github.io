I have quite a few posts getting ready to be published to catch up for the *cough* two months I've been silent.

That being said, I want to share a hidden gem I came across.

I can't say enough for this short film. I can only let it speak for itself. If you have the bandwidth, I highly recommend the HD version; it's nearly flawless.
