Miro, in my opinion, is like the iTunes podcast store on steroids. At the very least, Miro puts all the best internet audio and video sources together for easy consumption. It makes subscribing and downloading podcasts extremely simple. It has the ability to play content inside of Miro, or externally in a player like VLC or Totem. It allows you to manage your podcast/internet video library like an OCD librarian on crack. You can make your own playlists, and add external content to build an extensive collection that spans into the exabytes.

Seriously, this might be the most powerful and most expansive audio/video applications in existence. Not to mention all the amazing content you can discover by just poking around the guide.

Miro is full of cross-platform lovin'
