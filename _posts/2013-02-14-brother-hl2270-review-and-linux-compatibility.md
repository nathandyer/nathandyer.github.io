<p>Despite my commitment to try and be as paperless as possible recently, I decided that it was time for me to buy a new printer. I have to print papers from time to time, and my previous method of digging the printer out of my closet and having to hook it up every time I wanted to print something just wasn't working for me. Not only that, but the $30 HP inkjet had been having problems as of late, and was too expensive to maintain.</p><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl2270dw.png" /><p>The Brother HL2270DW caught my eye. It has wireless networking, good Linux support, and (after the initial cost) is actually really inexpensive to maintain. So, I did what any good student would: I did some math.</p><p>My old printer used HP 61 ink. It costs $18 for a black-and-white cartridge (and another $20 for color ink, though I will leave that out of these calculations). It’s rated for 190 pages, and in real world usage, I’m lucky if I get ~60-80. But let’s say I get the full 190 pages per cartridge that the manufacturer rates it at: </p><p><strong>$18 / 190 pages = .094736842, or roughly 10 cents per page of ink.</strong></p><p>My new printer uses the Brother TN450 High Yield Toner&nbsp;Cartridge&nbsp; The current price on Amazon.com is $48.99. It is rated for 2600 pages. Using the same formula, <strong>$48.99 / 2600 pages = .018842308, or slightly less than 2 cents per page. That’s an 80% savings.</strong></p><p>But, more than that, I really just wanted a great wireless printer, and I am tired and jadded from poor experiences with cheap ink-jets.</p><h3>Set-up and Configuration</h3><p>Set-up is dead simple. If your router has WPS (WiFi Protected Setup), all you have to do is press the buttons. If not, and you're on Linux, you can hard-wire it via Ethernet to configure the wireless networking, and then you'll never have to hard-wire again. And, if you're on Windows or Mac, you can also use the setup software if you prefer. Really, it couldn't be any easier or more platform-independent.&nbsp;</p><p>Installing the printer on our three machines at home was a piece of cake. They saw the network printer automatically, picked a driver, and it was working within like 10 seconds. Installation on Linux was a breeze. In the three weeks that I've owned it, I've not come across any connection or printing issues. And, because it is wireless, I'm able to just stash it in a cabinet and forget about it until I need to use it. When I do, though, I just print to it and am able to confidently assume that it printed successfully and is waiting on me.</p><p>I am really happy with my purchase. The Brother HL-2270DW is a fantastic deal, a remarkable printer, and works great out of the box with Linux. So far the experience has been great.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
