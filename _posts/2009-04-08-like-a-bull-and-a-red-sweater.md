I am angry.<br /><br />No, no, no, I'm not angry- I'm peed. I'm furious. I'm angry. I'm going to be double raped.<br /><br />iTunes rolled out their $1.29 pricing for all songs you actually are interested in buying today, so I dumped them. Forever. Gone<br /><br />And now, I get a <a href="https://twitter.com/CNETNews/status/1473414481">Tweet from Cnet that Amazon is rolling out $1.29 music.</a> <b> </b>What the crap!?!?!?!?!?! Am I the only one in the world that is furious!?!?!?! This is so against everything we've been fighting for! How can we move forward as an internet-based society if it's cheaper to live in the real world? I can't afford an extra buck for every three songs- who do I look like, Bill Gates?<br /><br />So how can I be mad at Apple?<br /><br />I don't suppose I can.<br /><br />I'm angry at the label companies, who are apparently behind this- but who knows for sure?<br /><br />We should boycott the jerks behind this...<br />I refuse to buy stuff for a month... or week... or at least a few days.<br /><br />Angry, peeved, peed, upset, let down, furious, and angry- did I mention that one?<br /><br />-Nathan<br /><br />P.S. grr...
