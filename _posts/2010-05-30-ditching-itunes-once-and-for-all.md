After a weekend spent tinkering with ditching iTunes, one thing has become very clear: we need an Android-based iPod Touch alternative. Spending time looking at how software interracts with the device, I've never been so sure that this is one of the most insanely difficult and confusing systems ever on the backend. Sure, it's super-easy for the user to use and navigate. Even adding music is a breeze with iTunes. But here's a question: why make file structure so odd? Why place music is specialized folders inside iTunes_Control &gt; Music and various 'F' folders. Why not, you know, have folders named for artists, with albums and tracks inside like everyone else? It's all about control and using non-standards.

I cannot express in words how deeply I want an Android-based PMP that is open-source, simple, and powerful. I want complete control. Android is the future of mobile devices, so why do we not have this all ready?

But this entry isn't about how much we need an Android player; this is about how I "successfully" ditched iTunes.

As you probably know, I'm a Ubuntu Linux user. If you don't know what I'm talking about, look at past entries. One of the most amazing additions to <em>Lucid Lynx</em> was support for iPhone/iPod Touch right out of the box via GNOME 2.30's <strong>libimobiledevice</strong> support. It is as simple as loading Rhythmbox, plugging in your iPod/iPhone, and dragging the files over.

But I have a super huge annoyance: it took <em>three and a half</em> hours to copy the music because of some current limitations and the architecture of the device. This is infuriating beyond belief. Also, there are multiple entries for albums (not multiple copies, to be clear) if the artist isn't the same for all the files.

That being said, it's over. From now on I'll only have to add new music, which won't take very long. And most of all, I've been freed from the bonds of iTunes forever.
