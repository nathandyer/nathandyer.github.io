Before I get all kinds of comments and e-mails, let me just say this: no, we're not trying to be just like Mac OS X. That being said, here's a dock like the one used in Mac OS X. I am a firm believer that a dock is one of the most efficient and effective ways of managing open windows and installed programs. In addition to the effectiveness, no one can argue that it isn't a way to make your desktop look sexier.

I don't really know what all to say about Docky. Really, it's a dock- but a darn good one at that! You can choose themes, styles, and sizes. You can have it start on boot, and use it to replace the bottom Gnome bar. The best way to do it is to choose the option "Auto-hide" the Gnome taskbar, and then just select it to start on boot.

There's nothing more to say. Here's what to take home: it's gorgeous, it's light-weight, and it's effective. Now, go nuts and download this thing!
