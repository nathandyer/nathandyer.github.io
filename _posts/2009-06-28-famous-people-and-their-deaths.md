I have to say, out of all the weeks I've lived through in my life, this one had the most celebrity deaths. First, Ed McMahon died. I really liked him, though I didn't know him well enough to really stand behind that. Then, Farrah Fawcett followed. I certainly didn't know much about her, as I never liked or watched Charlie's Angels, but I was sorry that she had such a tough battle with cancer. Then, completely randomly, Michael Jackson died. I liked his music, and I certainly don't think it's respectful to speak ill of the dead, but he seemed to be a very strange person later in his life. I see people going crazy over him, but you can't deny the fact that he dangled his baby off the balcony. Not to mention the entire child molestation case, but I won't get into that. It's none of my business and it certainly isn't my place to say. At the time of a man's death, we should remember the good in him and show respect for the life they once lived.

Then, the worst news of all came: Billy Mays died! Holy crap, Batman. I grew up watching his infomercials. I couldn't tell you the name of OxyClean back then, but dang it all, I could tell you that it was "Billy Mays Here" selling it to me! (And that's not all)

Let me say that my thoughts and prayers are, as always, with the families of these people.

That being said, I think that we need to truly take a look at society and our entire world. For the past three days I couldn't turn the news on or load the NY Times website without being bombarded by Michael Jackson's face, and some headline about either him, his life, or what will happen to his children now that he's gone.

Here's my quick thought for the day, then I'll log off and listen to 'In Between Dreams' to get sleepy: society looks to celebrities like they are all sent from Heaven. If people would stay in their own businesses and get out of others' lives we'd all be so much better off. It's like people worship other people that are famous! So what if people know who you are? I'm sorry that anyone has to die, but let them be dead and let their families just get on with their lives. I can't imagine how hard it is to lose someone in your family while the entire world keeps greiving and going on about them. Sometimes, people are just stupid. I wish that people would stop looking at People magazine, stop logging in to AOL, and for the love of everything that is the least bit good in this world, IGNORE STUPID TMZ! Every single person is on this Earth for a reason, and none of us are worth any more than another one. We need to stop putting people on pedestals and instead try to level the playing field. As Dr. Horrible so wonderfully put it, "The status is not quo. The world is a mess...". That's just something to think about. Me, I'm going to skip the NY Times and CNN. I'm going to read a few blogs, check out Digg, and think about how thankful I am for the "new media" revolution.

But speaking on the deaths one last time, I truly hope, wish, and pray that all four of the aforementioned people rest in peace and find true happiness in the afterlife. They will be missed.

As always,

Nathan
