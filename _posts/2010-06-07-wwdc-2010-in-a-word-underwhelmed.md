<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://live.gdgt.com/2010/06/07/live-wwdc-2010-keynote-coverage/"><img class="aligncenter" title="iPhone 4 WWDC Keynote - Photo property of GDGT" src="http://c1798852.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/apple-wwdc10_427.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="179" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I always look forward to the Apple Keynote at WWDC each year. I'm not a fanboy (not really even a fan) of Apple, but I always appreciate the leaps in technology each year. It seems like this conference is usually a catalyst in the technology industry that powers production and development for the year that follows.</p>
This year, I didn't get that feeling at all. Even before this thing started I knew apple would have to play catch-up to Android. Steve's promise: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/23/steve-jobs-on-wwdc-announcements-you-wont-be-disappointed/" target="_blank">"You won't be disappointed." </a>

Talk about overplaying your hand. First, we got the new iPhone 4 hardware. Of course, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5520164/this-is-apples-next-iphone" target="_blank">we'd seen it all before</a>. The great advancements: a camera that doesn't suck (still isn't as great as most of the cameras on the new Android devices, like the <a href="http://now.sprint.com/firsts/evo4g/" target="_blank">Evo</a>), led flash (my phone from three years ago had that), a front-facing camera, and a strange antenna system that improves reception. The killer feature was a high-resolution screen. That's a nice try, but it is still disappointing as can be.

It's running the A4 processor. A nice touch, but how many normal people really care? A gyroscope? Really? Okay, whatever. Video editing/capture? Phones have been able to do that for years, and editing can take place on the PC if necessary. Meh. Oh, and the iBook app? Do we really care? We had the Kindle app, and few people want to read on a device that small. Move along, nothing to see here.

That was followed by a complete restatement of the last keynote: iOS 4, iAds, change the world, yada yada yada. Oh, and the one last thing: FaceTime. Yeah, it's iChat with a different name. You knew that had to be there, didn't you? And any mention of Skype? Nope. Oh, and video calls are WiFi only- #fail.

So, basically, Apple did a poor job of catching up to Android progress, attempted to reinvent the wheel by adding spokes, and basically bored people for an hour and a half, all the while yelling at them to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5557458/watch-the-steve-jobs-keynote-meltdown" target="_blank">turn off the WiFi.</a>

Worst. Keynote. Ever. But that doesn't matter: people will rush out to buy it just like they have all the other times. I was underwhelmed and unimpressed. Sorry to sound so much like an episode of Cranky Geeks.
