I mentioned on a post a while back how good-looking software and web site designs change the entire game for me. What I didn’t mention was the software that is both beautiful AND functional. So, I’ve decided to share all the software that I can’t live without.

First and foremost, iTunes. iTunes is the most innovative jukebox software on the planet, regardless of what you might think. Sure, it is a little bloated, but nothing else comes close.

In a similar category, VLC is the most wonderful video playback software I’ve used. Once you skin the butt-ugly player, you can’t stop it. It uses everything it can for the best playback (I can run full 1080p H.264 encoded .mov files. I can’t even do 480p smoothly in iTunes). Another great feature is that you can actually crop a 4:3 to a 16:9, as apposed to stretching (the “oompa-loompa” effect).

Picasa, from Google, is the best image organization software I’ve ever used. It might not be quite as pretty as iPhoto, but it’s simply the best.

The only official Micosoft software on the entire list, Windows Live Writer is a terrific piece of blogging software. It publishes everything perfectly, works with all the major platforms, allows deeper font and text editing, and does everything completely WYSIWYG style.

And finally, Google Chrome. Hands down, the very best browser I’ve ever used, and probably ever will. It’s fast, it’s clean, it’s simple. And it’s sexy. Especially with one of the new skins.
