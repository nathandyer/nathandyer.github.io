<p>My old site has been migrated over from the old and busted WordPress to the new hotness, Squarespace. If you are seeing this message, that means everything has moved over successfully and we can all breathe a sigh of relief... *phew*.</p><p></p><p>This new site represents a commitment to perfection. Hopefully you will agree that the design is a marked improvement. Please disregard any sharp edges you come across. All polishing happens in my spare time, which is something that I get far too little of these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, all this means one thing: more blog posts than ever! Stay tuned.</p>
