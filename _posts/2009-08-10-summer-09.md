My dearest friends, Twitter followers, Buzztown residents, and blog readers:

Tonight I look back on my summer and reflect on the moments that made this summer magically delicious, like a bowl of Lucky Charms.

Much like a bowl of Frosted Flakes, it was somewhat typical and boring. I did get to enjoy a few things.

First off, I finally beat my Dad in both Air Hockey and Nascar Arcade Racing. I also got to eat the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=bennetts+bbq+gatlinburg&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=us&amp;cid=0,0,13190054746059303597&amp;ei=Bs-ASpjpA8KRtgerssTNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1" target="_blank">most delicious rack of ribs</a> I’ve ever tasted in my life. I had the chance to float up a mountain in a swing, and glide up on a cable car. I’ve spent evenings at baseball games, car shows, and cooking steaks out on the back deck.

I’ve also had the pleasure of witnessing wonderful things in the internet world. I’ve seen Buzz Out Loud hit the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-19709_1-10267690-10.html" target="_blank">1000th episode</a>, I’ve seen them <a href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-19709_1-10302978-10.html" target="_blank">interview federal CTO Aneesh Chopra,</a> and I’ve finally seen gknee make it to the podcast. I’ve had the chance to fall in love with Jonathan Coulton music, and fall asleep listening to either Jack Johnson’s <em>In Between Dreams</em> or <em>Sleep Through the Static</em>, and Leo Laporte’s many different <a href="http://twit.tv" target="_blank">podcasts.</a>

I’ve also had the pleasure of seeing many wonderful movies (Star Trek, Slumdog Millionaire, Fanboys, Ice Age 3), and terrible movies (Harry Potter 6) for that matter.

So it is with a warm, fuzzy feeling that I bid yet another wonderful summer a fond farewell. I look forward to next summer, and I wish everyone in a similar situation as myself a great upcoming year!

As always,
