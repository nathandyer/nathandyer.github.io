<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/screenshot-audacity.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-335  aligncenter" title="Audacity" src="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/screenshot-audacity.png" alt="" width="423" height="297" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This post will be short and simple, because there is really only one thing to say: Audacity is one of the most powerful audio tools in the world, and will make your audio-editing life a thousand times simpler. With Audacity, the sky is the limit. You can edit and mix multiple tracks, export in various formats (with various numbers of channels, like 2.0 [Stereo] and 5.1 [Surround]), and fix the audio however you see fit. Audacity has built-in effects that can do everything from normalize and bass boost to add tremolo and phaser sounds. Plus, with a nearly limitless number of plug-ins, there really isn't anything this can't do. So, whether you're wanting to record the next great podcast, or sound like T-Pain by drunkenly yelling into your microphone and auto-tuning the music, you will sound like a professional. Sure, there's a bit of a learning curve- but by the end, I think you'll surprise yourself.</p>
