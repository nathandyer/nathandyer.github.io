I can't say that I break bills much, but it has long been a habit for me to take any extra change that I receive and place it in my bank- a old liquor bottle from way back in the day. It has been routine for me for years, and I've always felt good about it. My grandmother always used to tell me, "you think that it's not much, but you keep adding more and, before long, it really adds up."

I've used this system since I was about 8 years old, but I never had the patience to let it grow. I used to let it fill up about a sixth of the way, then empty it out and blow it on something crazy. But, in recent years, I've been more grown-uppish. I've been saving for about three or four years, and I have enjoyed watching it grow from nothing to a nearly-full pile of coins.

So, yesterday I did what anyone would do- I dumped the money onto the floor and spent a few hours sorting and counting it. I went into the process knowing that I had a least $300 in change.

Fast forward two hours. I begin counting, and suddenly I come to a sad realization: it's about half that amount. I scratch my head, thinking, "Do what, now?"

Here I am, throwing little chunks of metal into a liquor bottle like some crazy biblical sheek for three years, then I spend hours digging through the coins like some crazed pirate playing in a pile of loot, only to realize one thing:
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Pirate Booty" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/132/354317062_7c2d945506.jpg?v=0" alt="" width="175" height="261" /></p>

Coins are a waste of time. I don't care what you say, $150 is a small amount after three+ years of tediously holding onto every spare sent. Coins feel small and primative, so I vote that we just get rid of them. I'm willing to spend $1 instead of $.99 cents for songs- heck, I'll give you a dollor every hundred songs to not have to fool with the decimals.

That's my $.02, and yes, that's a pun.

Coins are dead to me. No more shall I forrage coins like squrrels forraging nuts; I'll just blow it on a candy bar. U.S. Senate, coins are bothersome. I'm sure you'll get on that.

As always,

Nathan... the Landlubber
