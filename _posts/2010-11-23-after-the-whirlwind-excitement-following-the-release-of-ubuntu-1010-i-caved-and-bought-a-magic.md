<p>After the whirlwind excitement following the release of Ubuntu 10.10, I caved and bought a Magic Trackpad because it looked &#8216;magically delicious&#8217; and has drivers built into the newest version of Ubuntu. After a month or two of exclusive use, I can say that I love this thing. There have been a few instances in which I&#8217;ve missed my mouse, but I&#8217;m very happy with my experience, and once more full-fledged gestures pop up, I&#8217;m almost certain I will never be able to go back. If you have a good mouse, it might not be worth the $70 for you, but I love this thing. If you&#8217;re curious, give it a go.</p>
