<p>2011 is shaping up to be the year that Google stops being the golden child and starts stepping on toes.</p>
<p>Google announced via the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html">Google Chrome blog that they&#8217;re dropping H.264 support in order to push their open-sourced WebM format.</a> Which is a good thing for the open-source community, right?</p>
<p>No. H.264 is the most widely-used codec on the internet*. It was part of the HTML5 standard, so that the &lt;video&gt; tag could be used universally to make playback simple. Every podcast that I watch regularly, be it from Revision3, TWiT, CNET, or other, is encoded in H.264. </p>
<p>I mean, I&#8217;ve spent <em>years</em> encoding my video library in H.264. I have no doubt that it&#8217;s the absolute best video codec around. </p>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;d love for the standard to be open-source. And if WebM wins, I won&#8217;t complain. <strong>But I just wish it was nice and simple: for music/audio you go with MP3, for video you go with H.264.</strong> No &#8220;codec wars,&#8221; no over-complicating everything. That would be great.</p>
<p><strong>But not everyone agrees on the same format, and that&#8217;s okay.</strong> The problem that I have is when a company, like Google, decides to throw away a common codec that nearly everyone uses in order to push their own &#8220;standard,&#8221; be it open-source or not. As for as I see it, <strong>it&#8217;s just Google pushing their own format and limiting the options for their users (a non-open-source ideal), and the only thing that this can do is make it more difficult for content creators.</strong> I think it will dampen the creativity on the internet and only make it more confusing for most users. I can&#8217;t see people wanting to encode/publish two versions of their videos. This is not the way to establish an HTML5 standard; in fact, it seems like a great way to increase the need/usage of closed-source Flash. </p>

<p>*this is a made-up statistic. My short trek through the Google failed to confirm that statistic&#8217;s validity.</p>
