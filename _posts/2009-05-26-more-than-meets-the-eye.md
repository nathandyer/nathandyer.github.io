I haven't been updating Twitter or blogging lately- I've been REALLY busy. You see, I decided that it was finally time for me to let loose and splurge, so I purchased a ginormous 1080p monitor. I plug it into Windows- viola, it works. Full 1920x1080 resolution. Then, pop it into Ubuntu and-

Well, let's just say three days and hours of changing my freaking xorg.conf file and pretty much nothing short of coding this thing and I realize one thing: until they finally simplify the heck out of Linux, there's no way that most people can use it. I'm certainly not a noob, but dang it all I'm still not runnin' at full 1080p. I spent 3 hours upgrading to "Jaunty Jackalope" (but, that needed to be done) and hours googling crap, not to mention a few minutes on the Ubuntu chat only to find people knew as much or as little as I did. I finally got a higher res, but nothing like that I need or want.

So, why do I pick Ubuntu? There's something about it. Just using it makes my life easier and happier- when it works, that is. It's about more than the final project. Open software is about more than meets the eye. You see, some people marry into Macs or PCs and they're just happy. Not me. I won't let larger companies decide things for me. They don't care about the people, just the money.

With Linux, we care about each other. We watch out for each other and make sure everything works out better. It's never about money, it's just that everything is the best it can be for the betterment of the community. I suppose it's not a bad trade-off to have a hard time with new stuff to have such a wonderful experience.

As always,

Nathan.

P.S. Now I can't play videos. Sounds like a fun and challenging problem. I'll add it to the list.
