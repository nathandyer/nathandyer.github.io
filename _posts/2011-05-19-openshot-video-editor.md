<p style="text-align:left;">I've recently been doing more video editing than ever, and I wanted to share my absolute favorite video editor.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenshot.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-621" title="OpenShot" src="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenshot.png" alt="" width="480" height="320" /></a><a href="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/screenshot1.png">

<p style="text-align:left;">At one point I could say that there weren't any decent editors for Linux- but OpenShot has grown into a powerful piece of software in recent times. The first thing that I quite like is that it accepts an enormous range of video formates (anything that Gstreamer can handle, AFAIK). You can export in a any format, and choose all the output resolutions, frame rates, bit rates, and other options. There are a huge plethora of transitions, most of which are pretty straight-forward. You can add titles at the beginning, or can create really professional and beautiful 3D title slides if you install Blender. To edit the video, just drag the video down and chop it up however you'd like using the cut tool. There are two possible audio tracks, and it's simple to throw a sound file down to the timeline. I find that OpenShot is at least miles ahead of Windows Movie Maker, and on par with iMovie. In the future I hope to see a little more stability and more advanced features in the same vein as Final Cut Pro, but for now, I think that OpenShot is more than enough for most users.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">For now, it's only available in Linux.</p>
