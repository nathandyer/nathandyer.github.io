I give this book 2 stars out of five. I suppose it wouldn't hurt anything to give it an extra 1/2 star, but I don't see what that would really help. It surprises me, and, frankly, makes me a little crabby when you see all these people (read: 70% of the girls I go to school with) go crazy and obsess over this book (they also obsess over Robert Pattinson, yet they cared less when he played Cedric in Harry Potter. Just sayin').

I read this book with an unbiased view. Here's the truth, take it for what it is: this book does not deserve the hype it's getting. The details are pointless, the plot is unexistant until page 400, and the dialogue is ridiculous. Teenagers don't use corny, cliche phrases and say things like "You are my life" and "I want to be with you forver." This is stupid. I get that there's a connection, but my dear goodness! I threw up in my mouth a couple times. It was terrible. Was the author everanything other than a fancy adult? I mean REALLY!

I must tell the good of the book. Should be short. First, it felt like I was reading a blog. Geek points. Once it hit page 400, it was a fairly interesting story that kept my interest until the end. I must say that it was very predictable, but I'll overlook that. I enjoyed from 400 on. Plus, the author kept me reading 400 pages into a boring monologue of what it's like to live a boring, normal life... so props for that.

Basically, it was okay. Not the worst, but definately not the best. It was no Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, and shouldn't be treated as such. Maybe the others get a lot better- but I probably will never find out.

I'm sure the comment board will be filled with this one. Sorry, all you Twilight Fanboys out there.

P.S..... Harry Potter forever!
