<span style="color:#99cc00;"><span style="color:#008000;">New features are rolling out!</span> </span>After forever and a year of being unable to post a link to download software from the Ubuntu software center, I found a work around! <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">You can now click on the Ubuntu Software Center icon to download! </span></strong>

<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-248" title="Ubuntu Software Center" src="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/softwarestore.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" />
</span></strong>

<strong><span style="color:#993300;">I'm also adding social networking links on the site!</span></strong> WordPress.com is a little... hard-headed, so this is still being hammered out. For now, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">you can find these features as the first post on the comment section.</span>

In terms of how we are growing, <strong>I'm happy to tell you that we've way more than doubled all traffic from last month- and it's still growing!</strong>

<strong><span style="color:#000080;">And it's all thanks to you guys! </span></strong>If you have any tips or suggestions, or have any (constructive) criticisms, please contact us at any of these places: ossforthewin@gmail.com, <a href="http://twitter.com/ossftw" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and the comments section of any post.

Oh, one last thing. I know that our URL kind of sucks. While it won't be in the immediate future, <strong>I am working on purchasing a better domain</strong>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If we start getting a lot more traffic, I'll make the investment.</span>
