Here's a tool that I came across that I couldn't live without. As much as I love the Ubuntu One Music Store, I still typically use the Amazon MP3 store for my music purchasing needs. The problem is, if you want to buy an album, you have to use the Amazon MP3 Downloader. This is where the problems ultimately lie. The software is proprietary, and is incompatible with the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, which I use.

Cue Pymazon. It's a simple Python program. You point it to the .amz file you get when you purchase an album, tell it where to put the music, and presto! Your music downloads lickety-split. It's lightweight, easy to use, and works like a dream. If you use the Amazon MP3 Store, you should consider using Pymazon.
