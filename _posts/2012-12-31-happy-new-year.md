<p>Traditionally for New Year I write several blog posts, with predictions about what I think we're likely to see in the new year, what the last one meant to me, and what I hope to see in the future. Although I have written many of those posts for this year, I don't feel that it's right to post them right now.&nbsp;I'm tired and need a break from all the noise online, so I'm going to "reboot" by going offline (for the most part) for a few days. I wanted to celebrate my favorite holiday with you all, however, so I thought I would leave this note before I left.</p><p>Every year on New Year's Eve I watch a couple videos. Please pour yourself a nice drink (I'll just have water, I'm still not old enough for alcohol), sit back, and let's watch one of them together. Cheers, friends.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvFLKyAGzzI&w=640&h=360]<p>See you all in the new year. </p>
