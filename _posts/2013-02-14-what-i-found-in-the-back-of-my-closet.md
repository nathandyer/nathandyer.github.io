<h3><strong>Warning: This Post is Pointless.</strong> Continue at your own risk.</h3><p>When I went to Washington D.C. as part of the National Youth Tour a few years ago, I decided I wanted to bring back a souvenir for my parents. I didn't really know what to get them, but I came across a crappy tee-shirt shop and found a $5 gem. As the only liberal in the family, I knew my super-conservative parents would appreciate a "friends don't let friends vote Republican" shirt.</p><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/img_2084.jpg" /><p>Turns out they didn't find it as funny as I did. It's been gathering dust in my closet this whole time.</p><p></p><p>And just a fun little note to end on: I made a bet with my Mom that Barack Obama would win the 2012 election. If she lost, she agreed to wear the shirt to work for a whole day. She has yet to hold up her end of the deal.<br></p>
