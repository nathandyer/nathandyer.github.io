Yesterday my sister came up for my birthday. It was awesome in the face for many reasons. First, we ate at Pizza Hut. I haven't been to Pizza Hut in over a year, so it was extra fantastic. We then went to Wal-Mart, then to Arby's. Let me just say that the new Swirl Shakes (Or you can get tongue-tied at the drive-through and call them "Schwhirrl Shakes") are the most delicious thing that God has ever allowed humans to creature in this or any other planet, world, universe, or galaxy.

Not only is it the best tasting milk shake, but they swirl warm fudge around the cup (which is clear and makes me feel fancy), so sometimes in the midst of the cold goodness you get a blast of warm fudge. Whoa.

Then we went home, where she gave me my present and we played Slap-Jack. Note to self: Playing slap-jack upstairs=Curious and somewhat agitated parents downstairs.

After she left I used part of my present to buy The Fray's new album. May I also add that it's one of the best albums I have heard lately. At least The Fray is sticking to it's roots!
