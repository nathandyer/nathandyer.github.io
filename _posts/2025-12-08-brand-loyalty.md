summary: What do the things we own say about ourselves?
---

I spend almost no time thinking about the consumer choices that other people make. I don't care who is driving which brand of car, or which phone someone carries, or what kind of watch they have strapped to their wrist. I don't pay attention to the jewelry they wear, the purses they carry, or any other consumer choices they have made.

Okay, that's almost true — I sometimes do judge people who drive Teslas in 2025, especially CyberTrucks. But hey, nobody's perfect.

All that being said, I am guilty of putting a lot of thought into what the things I own and use say about me. One of the best questions I've heard other minimalists say is "if no one ever saw the thing you want to purchase, would you still buy it?" I think a lot of times we get things to signify to the world something about our selves. A principle we hold, a symbol of our status, or just a broad statement of "I'm this kind of person."

We spend so much time thinking about what others think about us, but so little time actually thinking about others beyond "are they a good person, are the pleasant to be around."

In a way, the things we own and use are there for virtual signaling. But I've never been of the opinion that virtue signaling is bad.

I try to avoid products made by companies who work against my interests and core values. When people see me driving a certain car, using a certain laptop, or wearing a piece of clothing, I want them to get the right idea about me. I value things that are well made, using fair labor practices and environmentally friendly materials. I want people to know I value repairability, sharing of knowledge, and a diverse and welcoming community. I want people to know that I am safe, and do not tolerate people who hold hateful or exclusionary opinions.

I know those viewpoints are somewhat opposed. It may even make me a hypocrite. I'm trying to square that in my mind. 

Driving a Tesla doesn't make you a bad person. Owning a used ThinkPad running Linux doesn't make you a good person.

But if I have to pick which of those people come to my birthday party? That's an easy call.
