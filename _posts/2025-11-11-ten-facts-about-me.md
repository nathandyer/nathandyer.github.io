title: Ten Pointless Facts About Me
summary: A rare opportunity in 2025 to jump on a blogging trend
---

There seems to be a trend going on where people I follow on Mastodon (like [Kev](https://kevquirk.com/blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/) and [Joel](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/bqc-ten-pointless-facts-about-me/)) are posting their own responses to the questions promtped in [this blog post](https://forkingmad.blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/).

I'm normally not into this kind of thing at all, but it made me hearken back to when this was a thing that *everyone* did reguarly on Myspace, and it made me nostalgic. So I thought, why not have a bit of lite fun?

## Do you floss your teeth?

Yes, on an as-needed basis. I use those floss pick things whenever I eat something that is prone to getting stuck in my teeth, like steak. I should probably floss on a routine basis, but I don't.

## Tea, coffee, or water?

Water. After my most recent kidney transplant I gave up soda¹, but to fill the void I've been mostly drinking Propel brand flavored water. I know it's not as healthy as run-of-the-mill water, but if it's a stepping stone away from soda, it's better than nothing. I still drink plain water, too.

I don't like tea. I love coffee, but have been afraid to drink any for the past year or so because of my experiences with atrial fibriliation and menieres disease. I think I have both under control with the new kidney, so I'm hoping to return to coffee from time to time. I have a cardiology appointment coming up soon, so maybe I'll get the all-clear there.

## Footwear preference?

I pretty much exclusively wear Sketchers Slip-ins these days. I find that they last a really long time, and I love being able to easily slide my foot in when I'm about to walk about the door. This is not a #sponsored post.

## Favorite dessert?

This is a hard one to answer because I have an insatiable sweet tooth, but I think chocolate chip cookies would probably be my favorite. I like a nice, simple chocolate chip cookie, especially warm ones straight out of the oven while they're still kind of soft. That, with a glass of milk, is one of life's greatest pleasures.

## The first thing you do when you wake up?

I usually take the dog out, feed him and our cats, and then scroll through Mastodon and my RSS feeds while I eat a bagel (everything, lightly toasted, with cream cheese).

## Age you'd like to stick at?

So far my current age, 31, has been my favorite. I didn't get to properly my late 20s because of kidney failure. I finally feel grown up and am enjoying life, so I'd be fine sticking around at this age forever.

## How many hats do you own?

Four: one fancy hat, one of those cab driver-looking hats, one orange baseball hat, and then a beanie.

## Describe the last photo you took?

A photo showing the progress I made in cleaning out the garage. Since we moved in a lot of junk has been living in our garage, but I've spent hours cleaning things and taking unwanted items to Goodwill. There's almost room to park my car now!

## Worst TV show?

The first one that comes to mind is The Walking Dead. I loved season one, but then after that it was a chore to keep watching. I eventually gave up around season three. I think they're on the third spin-off and like ten seasons of the main show now?

Of course, the truly awful ones I never even started in the first place, so it's hard to say for certain.

## As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?

I wanted to be a writer. Then, I fell in love with technology and wanted to do computery things. Honestly, I don't think I strayed too far!

Come to think of it, though, that's what I wanted to do for an occupation when I grew up, but that wasn't my real aspiration. What I really wanted was to be able to afford every movie I liked on VHS. I used to go to Walmart and lust after VHS tapes, but could only afford one every now and then (they were expensive!). I'm happy to report I do have a copy of every movie and TV show I want now! Albeit in digital form, and carried around with me everywhere I go. The future ain't all bad!
