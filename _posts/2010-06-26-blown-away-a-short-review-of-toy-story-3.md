Until recently I was very sure of one simple truth: sequels are never as good as the first. Typically, they suck. Sometimes they go so far as to ruin the awesomeness of the first in a series.

That is not the case with Toy Story 3. Pixar did the unthinkable: they developed an amazing film following two predecessors, all the while dealing with the fact that it's been a decade and a half since the first film was released. I mean, I watched Toy Story when I was three!

But I can honestly say that I was as captivated and as blown away with the new story today as much as I was with the first two when I was younger. Toy Story 3 was just remarkable all around. I'm trying not to be one-sided and have a few valid complaints, but honestly I can't think of a single one. Toy Story 3 was sheer perfection. Once again, we have hope about the future of film.

Please follow my advice. Get up, go to a theater, and watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.
