The fate of PC gaming hangs in the balance. From compatibility problems to differing requirements, companies don't like developing for PC games, and consumers don't like playing them.

But then, an answer arrived. If you care anything about PC gaming, you've probably heard of the new service from Valve, called<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank"> Steam</a>. Steam is an online game service that sells PC games in a uniform system from a number of different developers. No dealing with pesky DRM- games are tied to an account, not a computer. Plus, you can download the games you buy an unlimited number of times. You don't have to physically install the games, Steam handles everything. All you have to do is click the game icon, and enjoy.

Signing up is easy, buying is a breeze, and everything just works smoothly. It couldn't have gone any better. I truly believe that Steam is an example of the future of PC computing. The only gripe I can think of is game prices. It's a completely digital copy, so there are no costs to make the games/cases, and there are no shipping fees. Digital games should be cheaper, in my opinion, but I won't complain, since the service is in fact so good. Not to mention the ridiculously low prices of games during the Christmas sale.

Steam is great. If you game on the PC, head over and check it out. Thank me later.

As always,

Nathan.
