A lot of the internet has been abuzz with the stories coming out of China of Apple's supplier's poor treatment of mass production employees. The working conditions for the employees at several of the company's supply plants are absolutely appalling and miserable. Of course, much of the blame falls on Apple's shoulders; but what responsibility do we as consumers play? Are we just "feeding the beast?"

The obvious answer is "yes," we are all just buying into the idea of cheap labor and mass production. When we look at our shiny new gadgets we don't look past the hardware. We fail to understand the hands that have played a part in getting that device to us. Perhaps the problem is that the entire process is entirely faceless.

But perhaps the answers to improvement fall entirely upon ourselves, through our wallets. In the scope of things, electionics are cheap. And because they are so cheap, companies have to produce around the clock to have enough supply to meet demand. I agree that taking the financial burden out of electronics lowers and removes the initial barrier to entry, but at what point should we say "I'll pay two-hundred dollars more if the workers get better treatment, higher pay, and as a result fewer products are produced."

That'll never happen, but it's worth a thought.
