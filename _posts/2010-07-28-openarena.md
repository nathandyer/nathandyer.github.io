OpenArena is a game that has great potential in the open source world. This FPS is fast-paced and team-based, and is honestly one of the best games that I've played in a while. There isn't a single game for Linux that holds up to this one in terms of quality of the final product (except perhaps World of Goo, which isn't open-source). While there are certain bugs and glitches that get in your way, this game runs very well for me. I'm getting great quality and frame rate, using relatively little horsepower. The game is similar to many others, and has a bit of a Tribes/Quake feel. You kill players from other teams, and depending on the type of game you're playing, you do various tasks such as capturing the flag. While the arenas feel repetitive, I find that they don't really get boring.

The sad thing about this game that lessens its value is the fact that so very few people use it. I don't think I've seen more than 30 playing at the same time before. Perhaps it's the fact that it's not well-known, or that the audience this is targeted at is smaller, but there simply aren't many people to play against. There are always a few computer-driven characters to battle against, but no computer ever comes close to an actual human player in games like this.

Honestly, there isn't much to say. It's a great game: fast-paced, fun, and open-source. Unfortunately, the other players aren't there. The truth is that until more people start playing, it isn't going to take off.
