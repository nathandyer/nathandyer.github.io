Want to contribute to Vocal? Know how to make gorgeous icons? Then this post is for you!

Lots of progress is being made with Vocal, and now I'm at the point where I'm in need of a great icon. Unfortunately, my artistic abilities are sorely lacking, so I'm reaching out to the community to see if anyone would be interested in creating an awesome icon for it.

The icon would be the official icon for Vocal, and would appear in the dock, the launcher, and in the app itself. It will also be used on official pages like the <a href="http://launchpad.net/vocal" target="_blank">project page on Launchpad</a>, and <a href="https://plus.google.com/115162318639836328992/about" target="_blank">social media sites such as Google+.</a>

I am looking for something elegant that visually makes you think of a podcast or audio/video subscriptions. If you are interested in contributing an icon, please send it to me in a number of different ways:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/nathandyer_me" target="_blank">@nathandyer_me on Twitter</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/+NathanDyerdotMe" target="_blank">Google+</a></li>
	<li>Email me at mail@nathandyer.me</li>
</ul>
The more at home the icon feels in elementary OS, the more likely I am to use it. If I end up using your icon I will give you a design credit in Vocal’s about dialog.
