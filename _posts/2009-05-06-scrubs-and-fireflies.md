This post is about two things- a series that got cut short and a series that went on too long.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Scrubs Season 8" src="http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/2600000/Season-8-Promo-scrubs-2638545-1050-1344.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="251" /></p>

Tonight was the finale of Scrubs. I haven't necessarily been a faithful viewer this season, because I feel that this season is a terrible excuse for Scrubs. The story lines are terrible, the jokes are unfunny, and dang near annoying. But, that's behind us. I put it all aside because, like it or not, I have waited for this night for years. I've been watching Scrubs for many years (Just after the completion of the 4th season. This is season 8 in comparison). Never have I seen such a funny, well-written comedy.

That was the old Scrubs. I don't even consider the newer ones part of the same series. The fact is, I always wanted the series to last forever. I made a big mistake. Everything that has a beginning has an end. When we try to drag something on after it's time is up, well, we take away what's good about something.

The finale, though, didn't disappoint too much. The Janitor told JD his "name", and Dr. Cox delivered one of the most amazing compliments I've ever heard.

So, I raise my glass to you Scrubs. It's been a great run.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Firefly" src="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Christopher.Hopkins/firefly_mmo.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="269" /></p>

I also want to bring up my anger to Fox for canceling Firefly. It was brilliant, and well ahead of its time. It has a loyal fanbase and, frankly, got cut because of money. Nothing is as original, interesting, or well-done as Firefly. As far as I'm concerned, the future is not in Television Networks and Studios.

So, here's to you, Firefly.
