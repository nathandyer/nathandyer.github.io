<p>Engadget today published photos of the keyboard for Google&#8217;s upcoming Chrome OS Netbook, and it is beautiful to say the least. While I&#8217;m not sure if I like it more than my beloved Apple Wired Keyboard, I have to say that I&#8217;m intrigued. It&#8217;s taken a huge look at what keys are still necessary for computer users, and got rid of those that don&#8217;t belong. No more &#8220;home&#8221; or &#8220;insert,&#8221; and say good-bye to the CAPS LOCK- it&#8217;s been replaced by a dedicated search button. While I&#8217;m not sold on the need of a search button, I have felt for a long while that the need for a caps lock key has long gone. I&#8217;m glad to see that engineers are putting more thought into keyboards, and I hope to see desktop-based versions of keyboards with this exact layout. Simple, elegant design for future computing: I can go for that. Cheers all around!</p>
