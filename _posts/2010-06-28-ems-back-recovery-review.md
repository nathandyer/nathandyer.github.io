After the garbage that was Relapse, I counted Eminem out. I figured he'd been too far influenced by the junk popular nowadays to make a decent album any more. I labeled him a sell-out.

I was wrong. Eminem is back. I was dreading giving the album a listen, but I was absolutely blown away. The entire album is polished to an unbelievably great degree. All the tracks are powerful and emotionally charged. I would even go as far to say as it's better than some of his first albums.

If you're into rap at all, I implore you to give this a listen. I submit a nomination for the best rap album of the year. Glad to see you back, Slim.
