Due to an “unfortunate” snow storm, I have had nearly a week off with absolutely nothing to do. A <a href="http://twitter.com/acedtect/status/9163145993" target="_blank">tweet from Tom Merritt</a> led me to <a href="http://bornofhope.com" target="_blank">a website for a movie, “Born of Hope,”</a> based on the Lord of the Rings saga and made independently for very little money. The production value was extraordinarily high, not to mention how entertaining it was. For so very long, I have desired for people to start focusing their attention on the future of media consumption. People are growing tired of the old ways of thinking. Just today I read <a href="http://digg.com/d31J0Ai" target="_blank">an article</a> that RedBox, following in Netflix’s steps, gave in to Warner Brothers’ demands and agreed to delay the rentals of new-release titles for 28 days past release date. You have to wonder, have they ever been on the internet?

But perhaps deals like this highlight the evident truth: the future is via the internet- streaming and, often, for free. If you have a product worth paying for, there’s nothing wrong will putting a price on it- if you do what you love, people will pay for it any way! But never do something just because of the money.You can always tell when there’s care involved.

I’ve spent many hours on YouTube and Hulu, and these are by far the best examples of what I mean:

I look forward to the day when I can sit at home, pull up a webpage, and quickly become immersed in rich, well-thought-out media. It’s time for people to say ‘so-long!’ to movie studios who only care about turning a quick dollar, and instead focus our attention on people that truly care about making valuable content, simply because they love to do so.

It’s great to be back! As always,
