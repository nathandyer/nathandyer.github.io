It shouldn't come as a surprise for anyone to hear that I spend the majority of my time on a computer; in fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a time that I didn't have something electronic in my vicinity. Over time, my keyboards make the shift from being mostly plastic to mostly grease. Natural oils from your skin just rub off and have a party on your keyboards and trackpads. Not only that, but the netbook that I've used for years for my portable needs has the type of shiny semi-plastic that just makes everything a million times greasier. I couldn't even look at it without feeling like I need to take a shower.

So I did a search for how to de-grease a laptop, and<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5645396/de+grease-your-laptop-with-a-mr-clean-magic-eraser" target="_blank"> one Lifehacker article later</a>, my life has changed forever. As it turns out, you can use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to get that grease and grime off your laptop.

I thought they were full of crap, honestly, but I had one lying around, so I gave it a go. Basically, just wet it and then rinse out all the excess water. I then applied moderate force across all the parts of my laptop, and within about twenty seconds it was all gone. Of course, it left a few water droplets on my keyboard (maybe I didn't get enough water out the first time), but a quick paper towel later, I was amazed to find that the nostalgic greasy sheen was gone. The only dark spots on my keyboard are just the ones where my fat fingers have worn down the plastic over the years, but there's no magic fix for that.

I am amazed at how well that actually worked. I guess I'll need to keep a cache of Magic Erasers on hand.
