If there's a single question about your hardware, look no further than System Profiler and Benchmark. I stumbled across this gem after looking for a Linux equivalent of <a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank">Speccy</a>, the non-open source software from <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank">Piriform</a> for Windows that I actually loved back in the days before my giant switcheroo.

I can name nearly every part I put into my machine, but from time to time I forget specific numbers, especially when it comes to model numbers on my graphics card. This comes in handy for that. It shows everything, from CPU cores and clock speeds to  amount of RAM installed. It can list every boot you perform, the kernel versions you're using- honestly, it shows everything you could <em>possibly</em> want to know about your machine.

But come on, you know you want to show your geek cred, right? You want to show the world how much of a bad-a gaming rig (which seems strange if you run Linux, as games are so... underwhelming) you have, you know you do. This is where benchmarking comes in. You can run a number of different tests with this software, working your hardware to the point it's screaming for mercy- but in a good way.

When it comes to hardware management and getting extremely detailed information of your system's many specs, as well as putting your components through their paces to make the rest of the world jealous of your set-up, this is the perfect software for you. If you're a Windows guy, Speccy is great, too.
