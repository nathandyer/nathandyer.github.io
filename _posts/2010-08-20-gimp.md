I typically try to avoid reviewing software that I am simply unqualified to write about, but I couldn't stay away from reviewing GIMP. The way I see it, my goal is to represent the end-user, most of whom aren't experts at photo manipulation tools in the first place.

GIMP is one of the most powerful open source applications that I can think of, being as powerful, if not more so, than the commercial <em>Photoshop</em>. There are dozens of tools that allow endless possiblities for editing photos.

I can only speak to the usability of performing simple tasks like creating a wallpaper for this blog, which I recently tried to do for the sake of writing this review. While the controls can be confusing, all the functions are there. When loading GIMP you'll be faced with three separate windows. <a href="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/screenshot-toolbox.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-274" title="GIMP - Toolbox" src="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/screenshot-toolbox.png" alt="" width="109" height="525" /></a>The main window is where the actual photo editing takes place, and is also where you perform such tasks as saving, creating, and exporting. The "skinny" windows on either side allow for using the various tools.

The bar on the left is the main toolbox. You can select, remove, fix, crop, add text, and otherwise go nuts with edits by using this panel, and then using the main window to actually perform the edit. Likewise, the toolbox on the right (which I have yet to use as I have no understanding of layers or other fancy tools) is used for layers, color correction, brush sizes, opacity, and other options that aren't exactly tools.

Honestly, my knowledge of this software is pathetic at best. What I do know is that I was able to easily and effectively perform my desired task with the utmost simplicity, and it only took a short while to become acquainted with the features. Even if you're a professional, the sky is the limit with what you can accomplish with this software. If you want a great open-source Photoshop alternative, look no further.
