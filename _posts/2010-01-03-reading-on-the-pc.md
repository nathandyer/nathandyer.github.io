It's been a while since I've posted- December is nothing short of a crazy rush, so please forgive me. Although I haven't taken the time to put finger to key, I have taken the time to experiment with reading novels on the PC.  I had spent time trying the Kindle for iPhone app, but reading on such a small screen simply isn't something that particularly tickles my fancy. A while later, I discovered<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_85648511_4?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000426311&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=left-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1A10CNZ7GSTV7NCSK1HV&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=41072102&amp;pf_rd_i=133141011" target="_blank"> Kindle for PC</a> (Alternatively, you can<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_85648511_5?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000464931&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=left-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1A10CNZ7GSTV7NCSK1HV&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=41072102&amp;pf_rd_i=133141011" target="_blank"> click here for a Mac Version</a>*).

First thing that I admired was how lightweight the program was, and how polished it looked. I entered my login credentials, and it downloaded all my books. The software  syncs with WhisperSync on each load, which makes it easy to pick up on the iPod where I left off on the PC. After many hours reading on my LCD, I must say one thing: I am thoroughly surprised, and in a good way.

I never would have imagined that sitting down to read an entire book on my monitor would be very enjoyable, but I found it to be wonderful. Not once did my eyes feel strained, and I could lean back in my chair and read from afar. Not to mention how convenient it is to be able to pick up a book quickly, then put it down, do something, and come back to it. It's incredibly nice to go from listening to music, to checking e-mail, to reading a book, and back again. It became part of my computing routine.

Looking back, I wouldn't hesitate buying digitally again, although I don't have an e-book reader. Between reading on the PC while I'm at home and my iPod when I'm on the go, I'm covered. Plus, buying digitally is generally cheaper. I have to give Amazon a sincere round of applause; their PC app couldn't be any better.

But, that's my opinion. What about you? Do you think that you could stand reading an entire book on your PC? Drop some comments, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

As always,

Nathan.
