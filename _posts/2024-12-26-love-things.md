title: Love Things
summary: Love people, love (some) things
---

One of the things that [the Minimalists](http://theminimalists.com/) repeat constantly is "love people, use things (because the opposite never works)." I don't think I agree, even as a minimalist who is increasingly apt to get rid of the things I own. 

Most things we own are either either necessities, or things that aren't exactly life-changing, but there are a few things that I own that I do genuinely love. They add value to my life. There's something about them that makes me feel comfort or pride, or some other feeling. Maybe it's the way the handle feels in my hand, the weight of it, the unique form it takes, or something altogether different that makes it special.

There's a danger in becoming attaching to stuff, and letting things fill the empty spaces in our homes and in our lives. Consumerism and overconsumption are big problems facing the world today. We throw away so much stuff, much of which is still completely usable, with our planet and environment taking the brunt of the punishment for doing so.

But yet, I still think it's okay to love things. Not everything. Not even most things. But some, selective, special things are okay to love.

Building things with care and attention, pouring ourselves into the things we create, those are ways for us to show love to our fellow people, to connect with others who we might never meet, and is also part of the legacy we leave behind. I was here; look what I made. 

So go ahead, love people, and love things. Just love as many people as you possibly can, and as few items as you can get away with to live a full and satisfying life.
