I have two quick points to make, then I'll sit back down.

It's exam week, which means all the cluttered notebooks that I have are finally ready to be thrown out like a shirt that's two sizes too small. I emptied a couple notebooks, and then I had one left. Two hours later, I had TWO GROCERY BAGS full of paper that I'll never touch again in my life.

All of my notebooks added together, I must've killed an entire forest of trees this year. Not because I want to, but because I'm required to. I feel that it is simply inexcusable that we use that much paper each year. There's simply no need for the astounding amount we use day to day. It seems to me like people should have the choice of doing everything electronically, save for some homework assignments (math in particular) and tests. So shame on you, schools!

Then I get the DVD version of Taken (oh, btw, the unrated electrocution scene is amazing!), open it up, and I am absolutely blown away by what I see: a green DVD case made from recycled plastic (Called "Eco-Box").

Just thinking out loud, but if every DVD is america used a recycled case, how much less would we consume? See, that's the kind of thinking we need. We need to move forward and stop with the old ways of hacking down trees. That just made 'Taken' even more awesome.

That's just my quick blurb. I guess I need to stop blogging and study for another exam. Wish me luck!

As always,
