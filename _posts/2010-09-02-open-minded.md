When this little project started, I didn't know where I was going. I knew only two things: 1) I was passionate about the open-source ethos and wanted to share it with the world, and 2) I wanted to share my thoughts and opinions about the software I use on a daily basis. The open-source community has always been the backbone of this site, with a love of software being the stitching that kept everything together. It's been that way from day one, and it will be that way until we are a faded memory on the internets.

I never intended, however, to stay still and stick with the same routine. I wanted to establish what I am here for, but I always planned on testing the waters and moving forward as a site and as a community. Over the past two months, I have published many posts that I am proud of, and I certainly hope that you, the reader, have enjoyed them.

That was only the beginning, though. We are slipping on into the future. I want to focus on the whole open-source ethos, not just the software side of things. I want to talk about hardware, I want to talk about the impact of the open world on the rest of the techno-sphere. I want this to be a place where open-source fans, from beginners to power users, can come to explore and enjoy content created by someone that shares in their own views.

That's where we are. We are now Open-Source FTW. You can expect my thoughts on the community, on hardware, and on everything related to open computing. And of course, more software reviews than you can count on your fingers and toes. We're not switching directions, we're just adding a passing lane.
