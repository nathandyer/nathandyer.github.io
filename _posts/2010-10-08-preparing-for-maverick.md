It's only two short (or long, if you're anxious) days until Ubuntu 10.10 'Maverick Meerkat' releases. Before we can get pumped up about the new install, there are a few things you need to make sure you do before upgrading or switching.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/timon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-439" title="Timon says..." src="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/timon.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="228" /></a></p>
<strong>1) Back up</strong>

I can't write those words in bold enough letters. Backup up is always essential, but that importance is ten-fold when you're installing an operating system. Even if you go for an upgrade, things can (and often do) go wrong. If you don't want to lose your data, you must back up. <strong>Note that that is essential if you store your data in your home directory, as you will lose your data if you format and reinstall.</strong>

<strong>2) Export or Sync Your Bookmarks, Contacts, etc.</strong>

When you throw that fresh install on there, if you go that route, you will be starting with a blank slate. That means all your precious bookmarks, contacts, plug-ins, etc., will be gone, unless you back up. I suggest using Ubuntu One* to backup all that information easily if you use Firefox, as it works together in harmony. If you're like me, however, and are addicted to Chromium, there's a very simple sync feature that it tied into your Google account. Just click on the "wrench" &gt; options &gt; personal stuff &gt; and sync.

<strong>3) Save your Playlists</strong>

Whether you're a Banshee or a Rhythmbox person, or any other media player for that matter, if you've created a butt load of playlists, you stand a chance of losing all that special, personalized goodness that you've worked so hard to create. In either program, simply right-click on the playlist and choose 'Save to File'.

<strong>4) Make a List of Programs You Will Need to Install Again</strong>

I can't tell you how many times I've used a simple piece of software, reinstalled, and forgot what it was called. Do yourself a favor- if you use it, write it down.

<strong>5) Don't Put Yourself in a Pickle- Back up Additional Necessary Drivers</strong>

Sometimes, Ubuntu just doesn't have the drivers you need by default (although this is rarely the case). The best thing I can do to explain is to give you a specific example of what I mean. My wireless card isn't detected by default (at least not in anything from 10.04 below, we'll see if that's changed in Maverick), and won't be until I can connect to the internet. The thing is, I can't connect to the internet to get the driver because the driver I need is used to connect to the internet. Instead, I have to use ndiswrapper and manually install the Windows driver to get it to work. In this situation, I need to have a copy of that driver on hand.
<h5>Viola! After that, you should be ready for Maverick. If you think I've left anything out, let me know in the comment section below. The first part of my review of Maverick will be up around Monday, but until then, happy installs!</h5>

*Your results may vary. I'll do a review of Ubuntu One in a week or two.
