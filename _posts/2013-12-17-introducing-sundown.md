<a href="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/screenshot-from-2013-12-06-2252011.png"><img class=" wp-image alignleft" id="i-1364" alt="" src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/screenshot-from-2013-12-06-2252011.png?w=421" width="295" height="295" /></a>I am immensely proud to introduce Sundown, a really simple app I've been working on for a while.

Ever since I was a little kid I've been keeping track of how much of my day is already gone, and how much of it I have left. That's exactly what Sundown does. You tell it when you woke up and when you're planning on going to bed, and it does the rest. It tells you an overall percentage of your day, and gives you an idea of exactly how much time remains.

Once you enter a time, you can "set it and forget it." It remembers everything, so after you close it you can just pick up where you left off.

Sundown uses the Granite API and feels most at home in elementary OS (but will work in other Ubuntu-based Linux systems as well). It is entirely open source, available under the GPL 3 license.
<h2>Install Sundown 1.0 "The Moth"</h2>
<h3>Download the Debian Package</h3>

<h3>Add the Sundown Stable PPA</h3>
<strong>ppa:nathandyer/sundown-stable</strong>

*Note: as of right now, only Precise (Ubuntu 12.04) packages are considered stable. These will work in elementary OS Luna and any Ubuntu 12.04-based system. Additional series will be available very soon in a new Sundown Daily PPA.
