<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/google-play-logo1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1145" title="Google Play" src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/google-play-logo1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="406" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A while ago I blogged about a bad experience I had with Google Play, and the lack of response back from their support, but I have since gotten all of that taken care of, and a member of the support team got back in touch with me. As that issue is no longer really an issue, I decided to take down the blog post.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But I wanted to come back really quickly and put out a word of caution for those of you, like me, who were hoping that Google Play could be your one-stop shop for purchasing Android Apps, Books, Magazines, Music, TV Shows, and Movies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Even if you pay for HD content, it may not be playable on your computer.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the response e-mail that I received from Google Play support, HD TV Shows <strong>are</strong> available to watch on your computer, but HD Movies<strong> are not</strong> playable in HD on your computer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also know that I've found that claim to be partially false, as one of the HD TV seasons I've purchased (Breaking Bad Season 1) is not available in HD on my computer, only on my Nexus 7.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for now, my suggestion would be thus: <strong>avoid Google Play if you're a computer user that values HD quality video.</strong></p>
