<p>1) The Google Chrome notebook will be a flop. The OS is overly simplified, especially for not being a tablet, and the hardware won&#8217;t be a huge selling point (unless priced <strong>extrememly</strong> competitively).</p>
<p>2) Unity will be a success, but not the runaway hit Canonical is hoping for.</p>
<p>3) Improved compatibility/performance on Apple machines.</p>
<p>4) The year of the Android tablet. Those things will be <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>5) Not a huge growth in marketshare for Linux, but a nice steady bump.</p>
<p>6) Diaspora will be a flop.</p>
<p>7) The Ubuntu One Music Store will get more serious, with weekly updates and a more user-friendly experience (<strong>crazy prediction</strong>: video downloads and a podcast market to compete with iTunes).</p>
<p>8) A popular, mainstream game (examples: Call of Duty, Left 4 Dead, Portal [man, I hope it&#8217;s Portal 2!]) will either be ported or released with a native Linux version.</p>
<p>9) LibreOffice will be default office suite on most Linux distros and will feel the same as OpenOffice at first. The interface will be improved and functionality increased before the release of Ubuntu 11.10.</p>
<p>10) It&#8217;s worth a shot: <strong>Ubuntu 11.10: Opulent Otter</strong></p>
