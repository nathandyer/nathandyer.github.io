On any given day the majority of my time is spent glaring at a computer screen. By the end of the day my eyeballs look like a reject sample from a Clear Eyes commercial. About a year ago I noticed my eyes would get "fuzzy" and burn, so I went to the eye-doctor (or optometrist if you're fancy), where I got glasses. The fuzziness was fixed, but that burning sensation is still there. That's to be expected from someone who looks at a computer as much as I do, especially in the environments that I do.

The problem isn't entire the constant gazing at the computer monitor; it's the insane amount of lighting that seems to be everywhere I go. Don't get me wrong, I like light just as much as the next guy, but there is a limit to how much is necessary. Limiting the amount of light when using a computer for extended periods of time is absolutely crucial. Not only will it make you eyes feel better, but you'll be able to see the darn screen!

Basically, what I'm saying is this: in environments where the majority of all people are using a computer, and extra light is not necessary, turn them off! Or, for goodness' sakes, buy a lamp!
