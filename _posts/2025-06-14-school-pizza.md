title: School Pizza
summary: My million dollar restaurant idea
---

One day, when I'm wealthy beyond my wildest dreams and am looking for any excuse to occupy my time, I'm going to open a little restaurant or food truck called "School Pizza."

The menu will be as follows:

* Cheese pizza rectangle slice: $2.00
* Pepperoni pizza rectangle slice: $2.25
* Whole-fat chocolate milk carton: $1.00

* Combo: $4.00 (Includes rectangle pizza slice, carton of chocolate milk, side of corn, and peaches for desert. All combos are served in a segmented tray.)

Hours: 11am - Sold Out

I'll make a million bucks.
