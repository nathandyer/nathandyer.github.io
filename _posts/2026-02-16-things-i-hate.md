Following a recent trend I've seen of people listing 10 things they hate, I thought it would be fun (and a bit of a break from the more serious posts I've written recently) to come up with my own list. 

In that spirit, here are some things I hate:

1. **When people listen to things out loud on a speaker in public.**
2. **Trader Joe's.** The food is fine, I suppose, but the store is always so crowded that I end up anxious and panicked trying to move around people and not get in anyone's way.
3. **People who don't seed their torrents.**
4. **Ranch dressing.** Nothing personal, I just can't stand the taste.
5. **When drivers camp in the passing lane, going at or below the speed limit.**
6. **People who talk or use phones during a showing at the cinema.**
7. **When people bring pets into restaurants or grocery stores.** This obviously doesn't apply to service animals. I see way too many people bringing their dogs into restaurants and grocery stores, but no one asks them to leave so they keep doing it.
8. **AI generated photos and videos.** Oh, and AI generated blog posts. In fact, most AI generated things.
9. **When the plumbers/electricians/technicians don't show up during their scheduled window.**
10. **"The Cloud."** Benefits of instant data backups and easier sharing aside, most of our data can be stored locally just fine, where it doesn't get leaked/shared with the government to benefit the police state/used for training machine learning models.

What about you? If you end up making your own list, please be sure to link me to it.
