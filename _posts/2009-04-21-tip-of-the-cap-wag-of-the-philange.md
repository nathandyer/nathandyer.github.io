Following the theme of having no theme in particular, I have an uncommonly random, spasmodic collection of thoughts. Please note that this entry is strewn with  the funnest words ever, so don't count off for English boo-boos. Sometimes you just have to let loose.

That being said, let's get rollin'. The easiest way to do this is with a Tip of the Cap, Wag of the Philange (not to be confused with "Tip of the hat, wag of the finger" you might be familiar with on the Colbert Report).

First, we have a major <strong>Wag</strong> at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">President Obama</span>. Now, most of you know that I really like President Obama. I, however, seriously disagree with a few things. The newest and biggest thing that has made me angry was his decisiony pick on how we treat our prisoners of war. Anyone that knows me knows that I'm all for treating people well, but sometimes people get what they deserve. I'm not saying that it's okay to torture them, but, as far as I'm concerned, every single person in the states ought to be able to walk up to them and smack them carefully across the cheek. I'm not saying they're all that bad, but we can't go letting terrorists do what they want and not make them understand that all actions have consequences.

Next, a <strong>Tip of the Cap</strong> to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">open-source community</span>. Ubuntu 9.04 comes out April 23rd. Can't wait for that.

An equal <strong>Tip</strong> for <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Amazon MP3</span>, who continues to dazzle- wait, that's a little too fruity- amazify me. Not only does their software work well with Linux, but their prices remain considerably lower than iTunes.

Which brings a <strong>Wag</strong> of my Philange to iTunes. Perhaps the anger of raising prices to $1.29 was a bit premature. None of us knew that the labels (oh, let me <strong>Wag</strong> at them, too) were demanding digital stores raise prices... but then you went the jerkish, greedy old-fart way about it, charging $1.29 for nearly all popular songs. Amazon, being the better company, continues to keep prices as low as possible at mainly $.99, which is what you used to pay. You know, when they charged $.79 and $.89... just sayin'.

A <strong>Wag</strong> at<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> reality television shows.</span> They're really making me mad. Hell's Kicthen and Kitchen Nightmares, being my prime example (Though American Idol is the biggest offender), are a disgrace to the awesomeness that could be. Instead, they rearrange all the actual footage, add tense voice-overs, and make things more intense than they really are. I've had enough of it. It's time that television had a major makeover. I'll, on a similar note, add a<strong> half-of-a-cap-tip</strong> to the British version<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</span>. It feels much more indie, not to mention it's more relaxed and shows the actual events more accurately (plus narraration from Chef Ramsay himself). I don't care how many F-bombs you have to sift through, everyone should go to YouTube and watch some clips for comparisons. So wonderful.

We end with one of each. First, a Tip of my Cap to Susan Boyle. That was brilliant, awesometastic, and unbe-fantastically-lievable. Well done.

AND NOW A MAJOR WAG AT OPRAH AND THE 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE WHO SIGNED UP FOR TWITTER BECAUSE OF HER.

You're ruining Twitter.

You're ruining the Internet.

Join if you want to microblog, don't join to see what Oprah does- you can pop open a bag of Cheetos, prop your feet up, and do that from your couch. This makes me angry... You all deserve to get your Twitter accounts hacked and spammed... Grr to you all.

Oh, yeah, this is the first post on my new blog. I hope you like it! I've worked hard, so please pretend you do. I'm just kidding, that's not the blogger spirit- tell me what you really think! Let me sorry butt have it!

As always,

Nathan
