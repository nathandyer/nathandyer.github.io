<p style="text-align:justify;">I just wanted to chime in with my thoughts on the new <em>EarPods</em> that Apple is now selling for $29.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/img_18561.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1207" title="Apple EarPods" alt="" src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/img_18561.jpg?w=1024" height="296" width="1024" /></a>As is to be expected, they are very well-made. The areas around the jack are designed in a way that appears to prevent the jacket from chipping away over time, and is layered in a way that makes me think that it will be less likely to short out any time soon. The actual buds are also durable and don't show dirt or wax. Apple also includes a nice carrying case that keep your cords neat and tangle-free.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ear pieces (pods) are comfortable. At first I was pushing them in too hard, too far, and in a way that they weren't meant to be used. This caused my ears to become quite sore. After a few days I realized that I didn't need to have them in that deep, and quickly discovered how they're <em>supposed</em> to fit. I am very impressed with how well they fit in my ear, and how well they stay in considering that they're not in-ear headphones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the past non in-ear headphones have sounded tinny and terrible. Every pair of Apple earbuds that I was unfortunate enough to get hold of were immediately replaced for a better sounding pair. While I was expecting style and function, I didn't have high hopes for sound quality. Much to my surprise, these things sound <strong>absolutely amazing for $29 bucks</strong>. They are as rich and bass-y as every set of in-ear earbuds I've owned and loved, and I think that the mids are actually a bit clearer and less muddy. On the whole, they look good, they feel good, and they sound spectacular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For $29 bucks, it's a no-brainer.<a href="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/img_1862.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1204" title="Carrying Case" alt="" src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/img_1862.jpg?w=300" height="225" width="300" /></a></p>
