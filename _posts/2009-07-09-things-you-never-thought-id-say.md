Have you ever had one of those days where you'd like to take your computer, fold it up nicely, then toss it out of your window like a frisbee? Yeah, it's been happening more and more recently here lately. The MAIN reason is because of Ubuntu's stupid resolution problems. Sure, I can SELECT the 1920 x 1080 option, but do you think it works? NO! It spits out blurry lines of color, but nothing more than that. I can edit the configuration files all day long, change the refresh rate, do everything I can think of ever, but it never works. For the past month I've been using a 16:10 aspect ratio of 1400 x something, instead of the 1920 x 1080 16:9 aspect ratio. It looks like I'm running it in safe mode on a blind man's PC.

There are other Ubuntu annoyances. I can't play DVDs, so I ripped half my library, which filled up my second hard disk. I can't sync my iPod Touch with ANY program, nor can I play protected iTunes videos (someone remind me why I bought them again?). Plus, there are countless sites I can't access (I'm talking to you, ABC Full Video Player!!!).

Basically, everything's harder on Linux. I'm a HUGE Linux supporter, I want everyone to experience it. I want everyone to realize what a great thing it is. We need to support open source software every chance we get. We need to come together as a community and we need the ability to modify software as we see fit.<strong> I CANNOT STRESS HOW MUCH I LOVE, USE, RESPECT, PUSH, AND RECOMMEND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.</strong>

That being said, it's time to go full-on traitor. You've all heard me talk bad about Microsoft. You've heard me talk bad about Apple. Well, I'm here to talk about them in a positive note now. It's time for me to say things you never EVER thought you'd hear me say.

Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X are the best operating systems in the world. Now, I can speak much for Apple because I simply haven't used the OS enough to say anything, but I can speak for Microsoft. I have been using Linux for at least four or five months now, and each time I go to back to Windows I laugh. In Linux, you have hundreds of different files build into hundreds of different packages that go here and there- it's a mess! There's no organization. Part of a program is in this folder, part is that directory. Windows  is amazing in that sense. Everything is cohesive. Your program is <em>there</em>. End of story. And it's amazing how everything just works. You forget that when you go to Linux and you have to run 10 different commands and hope for the best. I don't care how user-friendly Ubuntu is, it's still a pain in the butt to use sometimes. You'll spend hours working on some crazy rig when you can just plug something in in Windows and it just works! As much as I hate to say it, it's hassle free. I plugged in my monitor, for example, clicked the 1920 x 1080 button, and viola, it worked.

And no matter how much I respect Banshee and Songbird, no matter how much I wish and pray that Apple would open its software up a bit, or make it so much less of a resource hog than it already is, iTunes is the best media player around. Period. Sure, I'm not happy with the crazy ways they run their business and rip customers off, but iTunes is an amazing piece of software!

As much as I hate to say it, they've created great software. I am still in awe as to how Microsoft could have built such a great OS that just works in perfect harmoy with everything, like a well-oiled machine. I can give them crap, but they do have something going for them, no matter how much I curse at them for being so closed-sourced and business-minded.

<strong>So here's my official recommendation: </strong>Use Windows or Mac OS X. Use iTunes. Heck, even use Media Center if you're dead set in your ways (though might I recommend <a href="http://boxee.tv" target="_blank">Boxee </a>or the <a href="http://xbmc.org" target="_blank">XBMC Media Center</a>). But, at the same time, I think it's important to show support for the open source community. Run as many open source programs as you can. But, honestly, I don't care what you run or use, just enjoy your darn computer- that's why you got it in the first place.

Oh, yeah. Don't use Internet Explorer. I don't care what anyone says, it sucks. It's like playing Russian Roulette with all the chambers loaded. Pick up a copy of <a href="http://firefox.com/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>.

As always, sorta,
