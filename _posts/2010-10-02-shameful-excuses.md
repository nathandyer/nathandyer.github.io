When I started this blog, I started with a promise: each week I would bring a few reviews of the greatest open-source software available. Easy enough, right?

Well, you'd think. Turns out, it's a lot of work. But that has never been, and shall never be, an excuse for not getting the content out. For the nearly two-week absence, I apologize.

Let me tell you what I'm working on now. I started a review of LibreOffice, but after an hour-long install and the realization that it's pretty much still OpenOffice with a different name, I'm going to table that for now.

<strong>But it's almost Maverick Meerkat time! The week of October 10 I'm writing a huge, ginormous, in-depth review of the newest version of Ubuntu. </strong>

You can also expect a review of Ubuntu One following the Maverick install, and a look at the newest version of Banshee.

Until October 11, however, I'll probably continue my habit of staying quite. Once again, sorry for going all "Where's Waldo" on you.
