<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1034" title="The Dark Knight Rises" src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/the-dark-knight-rises.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="212" />I was watching a review for the Dark Knight Rises, a movie that I can't hardly wait for, and it was brought to my attention that it truly is the ending of a trilogy, in that it builds on the first two.

Friends, we are living in the future, and it feels <em>goood.</em>

And just as a note to my movie-going friends, have fun and be safe! And, if you spoil a <strong>single second</strong> of this film for me, I will look for you, I <em>will</em> find you, and I will kill you.
