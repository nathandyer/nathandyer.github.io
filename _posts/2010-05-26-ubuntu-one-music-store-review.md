With the new LTS release of Ubuntu (Lucid Lynx 10.04) also came a fantastic new music download service based on Ubuntu One called- well,<a href="https://one.ubuntu.com/music/" target="_blank"> Ubuntu One Music Store</a>. The music store is DRM-free, and in <em>many</em> cases has higher quality MP3s (320 kpbs, as opposed to the now-standard 256) than similar online stores. In addition to the generally higher quality, much of the music is cheaper. The store is simplistic, tidy, and built right in to the new version of Ubuntu via Rhythmbox (or a plug-in for Banshee if you swing that way). <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=&amp;ved=0CBUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubuntu.com%2Fgetubuntu%2Fmusic-store-lynx&amp;ei=Ycr9S8ucOIL78Ab_i_m-Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmkyjd_MYf3asOB6t0T1YyKG2sNQ&amp;sig2=M-3ycHfWsq0494WdwlsseA" target="_blank">It's also important to mention that half of all your purchases goes to help save the Iberian Lynx from extinction.</a>

Those are all the pros, but there are always cons that need to be mentioned. First, there obviously aren't as many tracks available for purchase as Amazon or iTunes. Second, the download process itself can be slow and confusing. But perhaps my biggest complaint is that all purchased music is saved in your Ubuntu One storage, taking up space. This means that you will have to upgrade storage ($10/month for 50GBs) or delete the songs from your account, which could be harmful if you aren't a great backer-upper (I plan on doing a back-up guide latter on this blog).

Cons aside, Ubuntu One Music Store is a fantastic addition, and is easily better than even iTunes in both quality and price. Not to mention that you can feel good about buying from them. It's like you're giving to charity, helping the engineers and volunteers, and getting music all at the same time. Give it a short while to fix the little problems, and we will have a winner on our hands for sure. Thumbs up.
