<a href="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/abiword.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-52" title="AbiWord" src="http://ossftw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/abiword.png" alt="" width="600" height="345" /></a>By no stretch of the imagination is AbiWord a complete office suite. In fact, it's nothing more than a word processor. That being said, it excels at what it does. It's lightweight and elegant, and makes editing word documents simple. Does it have all the hundreds of features OpenOffice.org Writer has? Not quite, but it's close. It is about a billion times prettier? Yes. It takes away the clutter and simply allows you to pump out your musings. In terms of formats, it handles nearly all of them: .odt, .doc, .rtf, etc. I really can't say anything more. If you're looking for a stand-alone word-processor and want something that's powerful underneath, yet simple on the outside, look no further. If you want a full-featured office suite, look into <a href="http://openoffice.org/" target="_blank">OpenOffice.org</a> (the review will come out sometime in the near future).

Just a note: I feel that the Windows version can be a little... less pretty. For once, it just sucks to be you guys. I just wanted to tell you to let you take that into consideration.
