<p>Folks, I&#8217;d like to direct your attention over to <a target="_blank" href="http://humblebundle.com/">humblebundle.com</a> where, for a short period of time, you can get your hands on the Humble Indie Bundle 2. For those of you unfamiliar with the humble indie bundles, the idea is this: indie developers and studios come together to offer a bundle of five games (drm-free and available for Mac, Windows, and Linux) and allow you, the purchaser, to choose the amount you&#8217;re willing to pay. You can chip in anything from a few pennies to a few thousand dollars. The great thing about that is, not only can you get the games for a steal, but you can choose where your money goes: you divide it up between the developers, and two charities (being the EFF and Child&#8217;s Play). This way, everyone wins: you get games, developers get paid, and charities receive a helpful contribution. Please, don&#8217;t just do this for the games- by purchasing this bundle you can support indie game development and help share holiday cheer by giving back to charities that really do good for others.</p>
