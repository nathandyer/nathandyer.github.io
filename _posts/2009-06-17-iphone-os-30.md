After contemplating whether or not I would actually spend the OUTRAGEOUS $9.95 I would have to fork over for the iPod Touch 3.0 upgrade, I took a deep breath and installed it. I had a hard time buying the upgrade, because I didn't see hardly any updates or new features I really gave a crap about. I also dislike the fact that iPhone users get the update for free, but at least I don't have any expensive and bothersome contract  I have to pay for.

It's been a long while since I've had any Apple praise to hand out, but I have to give it to them, the new software is very zippy, pretty, and useful. Allow me to give a run down of cool stuff to check out:

First off, the Spotlight page is UNBELIEVABLY nifty and useful. Instead of crawling through all the different apps you can find something quickly just by typing. For instance, I <em>could</em> go to Music&gt;Songs&gt;Scroll to the 'C' section, then select 'Constellations', or I could just go to the spotlight screen, type in something like 'const', and select it as the only result. So much quicker.

We also have simple things like Copy and Paste. You know, stuff that phones from 10 years ago had. There's also the Shake to Shuffle feature, so you can shake to shuffle to another song. It's fun and useful, but I also feel like a dork when I'm shaking it like a carton of chocolate milk. Oh, well.

There's tons of tiny little updates and upgrades, but I'll leave them to you to find. The 3.0 software is definitely an improvement and is much better than 2.0. It wasn't as big as I hoped, but hey, I'll take it.

I tell you what, Apple: I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll let me sync it with something in Linux.

As always,

Nathan
