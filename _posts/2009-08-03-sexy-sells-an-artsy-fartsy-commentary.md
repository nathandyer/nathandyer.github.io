I’m an artistic guy. Used to, when someone used the phrase “artistic”, they likely meant an ability to draw or paint well. No term has been generalized and made more vague over time than that word, in my opinion. Clean, elegant, and beautiful software, web pages, etc. is truly a work of art that is never appreciated enough.

But this post isn’t about software. I’ll geek out on you at a later post, don’t worry. What I am trying to convey is the importance of being artistic. When I go through my music library, I typically stop on the Fray, Jack Johnson, and Paramore. Why? Well, yes, they are my favorites, I’m not going to lie. But more than that, they are artistic, particularly their album covers. I’m crazy, anal-retentive, and OCD, but an album cover is enough to make me stop or keep truckin’. I can tell a lot about someone by their album cover. People that slap a sans-serif font on a band picture make me frustrated. I’m going to listen to the artists and bands that take time to truly create works of art, both with cover art and lyrics.

I’ve rambled. What I’m trying to get at is that you should judge a book by its cover.

I often spend hours working on my blog, for example, getting it up to my standards. You can say what you want to about it, I know it certainly isn’t the most interesting or unique content and design on the web, but I think that you can tell that I take the time to put an artistic twist on it. At least, I hope that you can.

And people can say what they want about Apple users. You can call them fanboys, or a cult, but it’s hard to argue with me when I say that Apple designs the prettiest software and hardware around. They are VERY artsy-fartsy, and I admire them for that.
