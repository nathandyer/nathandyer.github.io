(Alternatively titled "What the Flac?")

I've been doing quite a bit of encoding lately, and one thing that is a complete mess is the large number of codecs available for use. It's almost too much for me to stand, let alone a normal user that wants a simple experience dealing with digital media. Here are my thoughts:

1) Audio. First off, let me say that the whole audio codec thing is <em>almost</em> sorted out. At this point, I think that nearly all of us can agree that MP3 is the clear winner. I'm a huge open-source proponent, and normally would never stray away from that, but in certain cases it makes more sense to follow the crowd. This is one of the cases. The world has basically adopted MP3 as an industry standard, and at this point I think it's almost more harmful to try to adopt open standards. We need to pick our battles. There's nothing wrong with Ogg Vorbis, but why add a horse when the race is all ready won? The only reasonable alternative to MP3, in my opinion, is FLAC, simply because it's lossless. There is still not a lossless standard, and in that situation, I think FLAC is the clear choice. But, really, isn't a 320 kbps MP3 good enough?

2) Video. Video is where the terror sets in. Video is like the wild-wild-west of the computing world. It's like there's a different codec for each day of the week and each letter in the alphabet. Some are open, some aren't. Some are compression-heavy, some aren't. Some handle certain things differently than others, yadda yadda yadda. It's time to cut down to simple standard. I think we can all agree that WMV is proprietary and crappy, and has no place in the future. DivX, Xvid, and AVI are old and outdated. Even the classic "MOV" is ancient. In terms of what is the most advanced and most-adopted we can all agree on H.264 in a M4V container. That being said, it's proprietary and owned by MPEG-LA, giving them the control in the end. In this case, I think we need to adopt an open-source standard. For a while we've had Ogg Theora, and in my opinion it is the one we should go with. Google recently open-sourced the VP8 codec as the WebM project, but why do we need Google to come in with a new codec? Why can't we just use Ogg Theora and call it a day? If Google would help, imagine how much quicker this could be over!

Honestly, that world is too complicated. At this point, we should have all that crap sorted out. As for me, I'm encoding in MP3 and Ogg Theora. You, on the other hand, can use whatever you want, as if you even care.
