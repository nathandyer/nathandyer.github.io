<p>After sitting the first few months out, I decided to jump in and try LibreOffice. I failed to report <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/libreoffice-google-novell-sponsored-openoffice-fork-launched/">back in September</a> that OpenOffice was forked and more or less taken out of the custody of Oracle (no comments there), where it was re-branded and placed under care of <em>The Document Foundation</em>. At that point it saw the beginning of a LONG series of ongoing improvements to make it a truly excellent word processor/office suite option.</p>
<p>And here we are: it&#8217;s all ready the new year. I&#8217;ve been following the progress of the project over the past few months, and have seen an impressive amount of performance-related bugs fixed. That being said, I never felt the time to switch was exactly right until now. A few days ago <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/new-ppa-makes-installing-libreoffice-on-ubuntu-easy/">OMG! Ubuntu!</a> reported that there was now an official PPA. So, I fired up the terminal and went to work. To save you time, I&#8217;ll post the commands: </p>
<p><strong><span>    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>    sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install libreoffice</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>    </span><span>sudo apt-get install libreoffice-gnome</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Note for Kubuntu users: you can substitute &#8216;libreoffice-gnome&#8217; for &#8216;libreoffice-kde&#8217;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IMPORTANT NOTE: Installing LibreOffice via PPA uninstalls OpenOffice.org</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I launched LibreOffice Writer, and my first impression was that the new splash screen made me very optimistic of the future of the project. It is simple, elegant, and refined: </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Sadly, in terms of the interface, that&#8217;s the highlight for the moment. While some of the icons are different and there are slight differences in UI, it&#8217;s nothing that we&#8217;ve been hoping for. The improvements thus far have been in performance (and I must say, it&#8217;s noticeable. It launches much quicker than before), not interface. As I said, though, the splash makes me optimistic. If they&#8217;ve done this well in</span></span><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lemsuouvwr1qe111y.png" width="365" height="276" align="right" /> design so far, I know they can continue to make it an impressive product. Make it work well, then make it pretty. If I remember right, there&#8217;s even talk about adding a &#8220;ribbon&#8221; interface in the future, similar to the one introduced in Microsoft Office 2007.</p>
<p>One of my only other gripes is that it fails to integrate into <em>gnome2-globalmenu</em>. I would be more forgiving if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that we have to install a <strong><em>gnome-specific package!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>That being said, for all the places that it&#8217;s unimpressive, it&#8217;s quite a remarkable step</strong>. I mean, it&#8217;s only been a few months, and yet it&#8217;s made leaps and bounds over the old junk we&#8217;ve used for years. I&#8217;m very satisfied with the progress. <strong>At this point, I would only recommend installing if you want to keep up with each little update. While doing so wouldn&#8217;t be harmful or decrease stability, it wouldn&#8217;t be that beneficial for most users.</strong></p>
<p><em>And on one final congratulatory note: LibreOffice has now officially replaced OpenOffice on daily builds of Ubuntu 11.04 &#8216;Natty Narwhal&#8217;. </em></p>
<p>TL;DR: It&#8217;s come a long way, it&#8217;s got a long way to go.</p>
