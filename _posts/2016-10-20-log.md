I missed the past couple days, my bad. I basically went to work and class- nothing to write home about.

* Up and at em at 6am
* Social media catch-up
* Class
* Took my senior exit exam (woohoo!)
* More class
* Early voted
* Visited my grandmother, then my niece and nephews
* PC repair for a cousin
* Will finish the night by going to bed ASAP
