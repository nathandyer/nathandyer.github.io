title: William Blake's Eternity
---

I stumbled upon the poem 'Eternity' by William Blake earlier this week, and it's been stuck in my mind ever since:

> He who binds himself to a joy
>
> Does the winged life destroy
> 
> He who kisses the joy as it flies
> 
> Lives in eternity's sunrise


I often bind myself to various joys, usually at the cost of overall life enjoyment. I need to try and keep this tucked away in the back of my head and remember to "kiss the joy as it flies." 

What a lovely little poem.
