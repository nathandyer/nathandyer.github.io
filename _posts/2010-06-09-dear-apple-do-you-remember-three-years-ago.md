<p>Dear Apple,</p>  <p>Do you remember three years ago? You know, when the iPod Touch launched alongside the iPhone and everyone was utterly speechless and blown away? Those were good times. Remember when people would go into stores just to touch the innovative devices in real life? Remember when kids would go to sleep at night thinking about those gadgets, praying that they might be lucky enough to save up enough money to buy one?</p>  <p>I remember three years ago. I remember that it was $299 for an iPod Touch with 8GBs of storage. I remember waiting until I could find one on sale because I didn’t have enough change to my name to even buy one at full price. Finally, my time had come. Wal-mart had some for $299 with a free $50 iTunes card. After all, an iTunes card is the same as money to a nerdy kid. I remember the feeling of paying with my own money in the check-out line, of lifting the cardboard lid from the case and admiring the beauty of the perfectly-engineered hardware perched atop a black plastic insert. It was nerdvana. It was like Christmas. I got warm fuzzies just listening to that thing.</p>  <p>And I really remember three years ago when I get shunned in the latest firmware update that Apple announced three days ago. The iPod Touch 1st Generation has apparently reached the end of software releases, essentially leaving it in a zombified state for the rest of its life. Talk about being forced to bend over and take it up the tail pipe. I guess I’ll enjoy holding onto three years ago while all the hipsters enjoy their fancy backgrounds and their multitasking. </p>  <p>Thanks Apple. </p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>-A disappointed customer</p>
