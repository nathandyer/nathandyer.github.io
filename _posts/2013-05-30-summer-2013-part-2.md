<p>I'm now roughly two weeks into Summer 2013. </p><p>Progress on my first Linux app, Sundown, has been going well so far. I'm nowhere near ready to release version 0.1, but looking back on the work that has been done, I'm pleased with how far along I am.&nbsp;</p><p>I had never used GTK before, nor had I used the Vala programming language. Both have fairly steep learning curves, but I have learned an incredible amount just in the past few weeks. I now have a minimally functioning application, a main window, a welcome screen, time pickers (many of those are part of the Granite API), and have some of the back-end functions and components ready to be implemented in the main part of the app. Slowly but surely, it's coming together.</p><p>I'm going to play it by ear, take it slow, and enjoy the experience, but I think I will have a functional development release (0.1) ready in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p></p><p>Until then,</p><p>while (sundown_first_dev_release.ready() == false) {</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; keep_coding();</p><p>}</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
