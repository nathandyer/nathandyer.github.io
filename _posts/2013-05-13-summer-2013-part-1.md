<p>Summer 2013 is now officially underway.&nbsp;</p><p>After finishing my first year of college and moving back to Avery for the summer, I am excited to be able to start spending my days having fun and being productive.</p><p>My "big goal" for the summer is to launch my first Linux app.<a href="https://launchpad.net/sundown" target="_blank"> I registered the project on Launchpad a while ago</a>, but now I am finally ready to start putting some real work into it. For a quick summary, it's an elementary HIG compliant time tracking app. It's called Sundown.</p><p>The first version is meant to give you an overview of how much time has progressed in any given day. After that, I'll add time management functionality. I have some ideas up my sleeve for some unique features that I think will make it a really compelling product, but it's too early in the game to start discussing them yet.</p><p>So, here's the gameplan:</p><ul><li>This week I'm going to settle in, get comfy, and read up on all the GTK+ documentation I can get my hands on (I've never used it before, but I am excited to get started).</li><li>After that, I'm going to work on getting version 0.1 out the door. I expect that to be ready before the end of the month.</li></ul><p>Expect updates to follow! Until then, let's learn some Vala and GTK+.</p><p></p><p></p>
