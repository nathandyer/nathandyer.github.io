<cite>Question:</cite> <q>It seems for a while I was able to post comments on some of your posts although now I can&#039;t seem to find the place to do it. Also how do you like tumbler? I know there is no way for me to ever use it, but it seems like a nice way of posting and viewing peoples opinions.<br />

<cite>Answer:</cite><q><p>I apologize, when I switched themes it took away the Disqus settings and I didn&#8217;t notice. The comments should now be back in place. As for Tumblr, I&#8217;ve found it very hit and miss so far. While it&#8217;s much easier for me to share content and the UI is more appealing, the stability has been pretty rocky. Service has been flaky, not to mention the big Tumblr outage a few weeks ago. I also find that it&#8217;s lacking some of the customization options I often want. That aside, it&#8217;s great for posting content, and the interaction between the creators/readers is the best I&#8217;ve seen.</p></q>
