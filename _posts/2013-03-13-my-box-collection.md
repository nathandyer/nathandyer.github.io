<p>My dad used to keep empty boxes from things he bought in a drawer in his dresser. As a little kid, I used to like to dig around in there and look at them all. Later, when my parents bought me a Gameboy Advance SP, the first thing my dad told me was, "be sure and hang onto the box."&nbsp;</p><p>I'm now an adult, and I find myself with a bottom drawer full of boxes.</p><p>Not all packages get a place in my coveted drawer, mind you. All the ones from my childhood have disappeared- some thrown away, some sold alongside the products they once held, and some broken down over time. The only ones that remain are ones that are gorgeous, interesting, and/or thoughtful. Incidentally, most of them tend to be Apple boxes.</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper"><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2115.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2116.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2117.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2120.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2124.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2129.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2130.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2131.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2133.jpg" /><img src="http://nathandyer.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2134.jpg" /></div><p>A lot of times people don't stop to&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;the&nbsp;subtleties&nbsp;of things. Some companies just slap logos on boxes and throw the products in the box. Those are the companies that don't find their way to my drawer.</p><p>Take, for example, some of the boxes pictured in the slideshow above. The Magic Mouse plastic box is one of my favorites. I love the way the mouse looks when it sits on the bottom cradle. It holds the mouse securely, and shows it off like a car in a showroom. Also, as with every single Apple product I've ever purchased (of which there are many), a nice bundled packet of information is placed thoughtfully at the very bottom. No matter how small or obvious the product may be, like the EarPods, Apple not only takes the time to package it beautifully, but they include information about the product (instructions, warranty information, etc.). It's not obtrusive, but it's there for when you need it. It's consistent and friendly packaging.</p><p>I also really like the ThinkPad box. It has character, and matches the "personality" of my ThinkPad X220. Sure, it may just be a cardboard box, but for some reason I find myself really loving it. That one, too large for the drawer, sits tucked away in a corner of my closet.</p><p>Lastly (at least for this post), the box my SSD came in really intrigued me. I love how small and simple it is. I like how you just raise the lid and it's there, packed in a cushioned protector. It's such a great design.</p><p>At the end of the day, I know I should probably throw the boxes away. To many, it would be considered trash. Not only that, but it's no secret that I have been on a mission to declutter my life and get rid of as many physical objects as possible. But, call me crazy, I feel attached to them. And as long as I continue to appreciate them, they will stay in my drawer.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
