Not blogging about this new Twitter client would, frankly, be a disservice to this blog. After putting off installing Hotot because I didn't need "another useless Twitter client," I finally caved in. It seemed to be generating quite a bit of buzz over at <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/hotot-the-hottest-new-twitter-app-for-linux/" target="_blank">OMG!Ubuntu!</a>, and I really liked the way that the screenshot looked. It was simple, elegant, and reminiscent of some of the Twitter clients from iOS.

I am very glad that I installed. While it is still in Alpha, my results so far have been very nice. And it's <em>so</em> sexy. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves:

Other things that I've noticed that I quite like:

1. Simple icons that make navigating simple.

2. A button for automatic URL shortening

3. Animations between panels

4. Inline photos

5. Toolbar placed over posts for retweeting, replaying, DMing, etc.

6. Did I mention how great it looks?

If you're a Linux user, you should stop reading this and just click the download link at the bottom of the page. As far as I'm concerned, they've hit this one right out of the proverbial park.
