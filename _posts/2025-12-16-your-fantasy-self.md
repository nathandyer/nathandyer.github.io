title: Your Fantasy Self
summary: You are who you are
---

In [a post earlier this month](https://nathandyer.me/2025/12/06/contribute-now.html) I tried to explain one of the principles of minimalism that had to do with being realistic about your current self, rather than who you wish you were. I don't think my explanation was all that clear, but then I came across a Reddit post that perfectly encapsulated what I was trying to say:

> I began decluttering and slowly realized the hardest things to let go of weren’t simply useful or sentimental, for they were the objects tied to small fantasies about who I imagined I might become. As the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan suggested, our attachment isn’t really to the object of desire itself, but to the fantasy that keeps desire in motion.
> 
> Once I admitted I wasn’t actually living in those imagined scenes, the objects stopped feeling meaningful. They were just things, now stripped of the narrative glow I’d projected onto them.
> 
> Letting them go felt less like decluttering and more like telling the truth.
> 
> Minimalism, in that sense, is the clearing away of fantasy; the physical stuff simply follows.
> 
> from `noblegeist` via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1p7a0xo/minimalism_is_not_just_the_decluttering_of_things/)

That says everything better than I could!
