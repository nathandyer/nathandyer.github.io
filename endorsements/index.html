    I understand that providing a mainfest of everything in my pockets, stuffed into my backpack, or otherwise sitting in my apartment is perhaps not the wiseest idea ever, but what can I say, I'm an optimist. I'd take it as a kindness if you didn't steal my things. 

    <h2>Daily Carry</h2>

    	* [Charlie Wallet, by Herschel](https://herschel.com/shop/wallets/charlie-wallet) - A great looking, durable, light-weight minimalist wallet. Has room for up to four cards (two debit cards, insurance, and drivers license in my case), plus a little pouch for your [mugging money](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed/episodes/anthropocene-reviewed-auld-lang-syne). Barely noticeable in my front pocket.
    	* [Streamlight MicroStream Flashlight](https://www.streamlight.com/products/detail/index/microstream) - This is a perfect daily carry flashlight. It uses a standard AAA battery, so it's always easy to keep it powered up. It fits neatly in the corner of my pocket and puts out a ton of light. Plus, you can remove the button cover and turn it from a recessed button to a protruding button (I always leave this cover off).
    	* [Opinel No. 8 Pocket Knife](https://www.opinel-usa.com/products/opinel-no-8-carbon-steel-folding-knife) - This is everything you could ask for in a pocket knife. A reasonably long, sharp blade in an elegant package this is excellent to grip, and has the ability to lock the blade so you don't accidentally close or open it (depending).
    	* [Fisher Bullet Space Pen](https://www.spacepen.com/400B.aspx) - This ink pen has a pressurize cartridge so that it's always ready to write, and folds up to half its size. Made of metal and clips onto the pocket next to my flashlight. I like having my own pen to sign credit card receipts at restaraunts, especially during the pandemic. I find myself using it for all kinds of other things throughout the day. You almost always need a pen.
