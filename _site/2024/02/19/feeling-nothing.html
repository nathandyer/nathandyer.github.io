  <section class="post-content"><p>There’s a line from the movie 500 Days of Summer that often plays in my head. The clip is here:</p>

<video muted="" controls="" width="640" height="480">
    <source src="http://localhost:4000/img/hair.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

<p>but for those not wanting to watch a 20 second video, it involves a narrator telling us a little bit about the personality of a woman named Summer, in which he describes:</p>

<p>“Since the disintegration of her parents marriage, she’d only loved two things: the first was her long, dark hair; and the second was how easily she could cut it off and feel nothing.”</p>

<p>As a child, I was incredibly sentimental. Any time I was given a gift by someone, or any time I felt that something I owned was of unique importance, it was nearly impossible for me to get rid of it. It felt like a betrayal of trust, or a denial of love.</p>

<p>This is something I’ve decidedly grown out of since then. Now, I find that with only the rarest of exceptions, I can mercilessly whittle down my personal collection of things without any hesitation.</p>

<p>Within recent memory, I moved homes three time within a single year. Each time, fewer things made the trip. After the third move, it became an obsession of mine to remove as much as possible.</p>

<p>Then, this past year, that drive kicked in harder and more forcefully than ever before. Starting home dialysis meant that I was suddenly inundated with hundreds of boxes of things that I needed to survive. I suppose the drive to remove all other non-essentials was a result of all that being foisted upon me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to get rid of everything I own, and there are still some things that mean a great deal to me. But by and large, I have trimmed all of my excess possessions, and am enjoying a leaner lifestyle with the handful of things I choose to keep.</p>

<p>All of this is to say, I’ve been a minimalist for a while, and that feeling has only grown over the past half decade. Much like Summer, I’m proud of how much I can cut things out, and feel nothing.</p>
