        <title>The Secret Trick to Make Water Bottles Stay Clean for Days (It&apos;s Ice)</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/10/09/water-bottles.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/10/09/water-bottles.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For ages I’ve wondered how some people seem to carry around the same water bottle with them, day after day, everywhere they go. Any time I’ve attempted the same, my water bottle would inevitably develop a funky smell, usually before the end of the day but always before day #2. More than that, it turned into a veritable petri dish, surely a menace not only to my health but the health of the population at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a good wash would fix the issue immediately, but I never really saw that people were washing their bottles throughout the day, or even nightly. How were they pulling off this astonishing feat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret to making a water bottle stretch for days and days on a single wash is to use ice. Having a bottle with good insulation, double-walled if you can spring for it, doesn’t hurt, but without ice even that can only get you so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you let it run out of ice and the temperature rises from chilly to lukewarm, the gig is up. You have lost. Return the bottle to the nearest dishwasher or sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you keep it cold, and replenish the ice daily, you too can achieve these feats of magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But please still give your bottle the ole sniff test on a regular basis, and wash as soon as it’s iffy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Asahi Linux with GNOME As a Daily Driver in Late 2024</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/10/08/asahi.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/10/08/asahi.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I decided to purchase a MacBook Air M2, with the specific purpose of running Asahi Fedora Remix. I chose this particular model because it’s the newest chipset that is supported by Asahi, and Best Buy was having a $200 off sale on them, presumably before Apple announces a new slate of laptops and stops offering the aging M2-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/macbook-air-asahi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several things I really loved about the system (battery life was astounding, the trackpad was marvelous, and the display was beautiful), but ultimately I made the decision to return it; the experience just wasn’t what I needed for a daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I plan to answer the questions I had before purchasing the system, and either couldn’t find, or had to really work to track down the info. To be clear: I do think that it’s usable enough for some people to use as a daily driver; it was just more than I was willing to put up with, especially for the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t really cover things that are mentioned in the Asahi wiki/knowledgebase. Certain hardware features are not yet supported; covering them here would be redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important note: I am a die-hard GNOME user, so my experience was that of someone using GNOME Shell and almost exclusively libadwaita-based apps. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; install plasma-desktop for the sake of comparison; some things worked better there (mainly fractional scaling), but overall there wasn’t a ton of difference either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-that-were-broken&quot;&gt;Things That Were Broken&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night Light&lt;/strong&gt;: with the display driver that is used by default in Asahi Fedora Remix, Night Light is completely unsupported. I rely on this feature heavily for visual comfort.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video hardware acceleration&lt;/strong&gt; isn’t working yet. I knew this going in, but the prevailing public opinion seemed to be “the software renderer is so fast you’ll never notice it.” Suffice to say, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; notice it. 1080p video playback was fine, but it struggled to play 4K content smoothly, and playing 4K content while also trying to tonemap HDR to SDR (something that is necessary with HDR not yet being supported by Linux) slowed the machine down to a crawl, while also making it get worryingly hot to the touch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High RAM usage&lt;/strong&gt;. On my other daily driver, I often see RAM hovering at around the ~4GB mark. On this system, it was almost always right at the 8GB threshold, with the swap use continually climbing into the several GB range as well. I think this &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be related to using the experimental fractional scaling (necessary for this display), but the performance overall just was not what I had hoped.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DRM playback&lt;/strong&gt; does not work. I almost didn’t catch this because I almost never watch anything that requires DRM, but one day while trying to watch an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Price is Right&lt;/em&gt; on my lunch break, I realized that it was failing to play the video because DRM wasn’t enabled. When I checked Firefox, the option wasn’t there in the usual spot. I installed Chromium for giggles, and likewise, it was not an option. I suspect it’s an issue with aarch64 not being supported by Widevine on Linux, but I haven’t done any further homework than that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apps that use &lt;strong&gt;WebkitGTK&lt;/strong&gt; were terribly sluggish. I’m not sure why, but any app that used WebkitGTK (I noticed this most in GNOME Web/Epiphany and Newsflash) were slow and stuttery, especially when the web view was visible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Random graphical artifacts. This was hard to track down, but I noticed random black boxes, rendering oddities, and in an especially humorous turn, text that would occasional render in “Mocking Spongebob Mode” (yOu kNoW WhEn tEXt lOOkS lIKE thiS). It was most noticeable with libadwaita-based apps, which is almost every app I use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting up &lt;strong&gt;disk encryption&lt;/strong&gt; is a headache that you probably won’t do. I generally rely on encryption for every digital device I use, but was put off by the headache of trying to set up a LUKS-encrypted boot partition for Asahi. It sounds possible if you monkey around with USB-based install solutions and custom partitioning, but life is too short for me to get that figured out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-does-linux-handle-the-notch&quot;&gt;How Does Linux Handle the Notch?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It handles it by pretending it’s not there! It just crops that portion of the display, giving you a perfect 16:10 aspect ratio, with no notch visible. There is a kernel option you can set to &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt; the notch, but I recommend against it if you are a GNOME user, as you would lose the clock/notification area (or at the least, would have to install an extension to relocate its position).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-is-the-battery-life&quot;&gt;How Is The Battery Life?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing! Depending on how much I babied it, I would almost always get 8 hours, and would often get as much as 12. The battery life on macOS is better, no question, but it’s not so much lower in Linux that you will be tempted back to macOS for the battery life alone (probably).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overall-thoughts&quot;&gt;Overall Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The M-based MacBooks are really spectacular machines. The build quality is exceptional, the battery life is remarkable, and overall I can’t say enough great things about them. They are likely not, however, the best choice for someone whose daily driver is Linux, or who develops for a Linux-based platform such as GNOME.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rallying Behind an Undeserving Browser Will Not Save the Open Web</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/10/04/firefox.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/10/04/firefox.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rallying behind an undeserving browser will not save the open web. If Mozilla is our last hope, we are already doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a Mozilla/Firefox user since I was around five years old, even before I knew what a “web browser” was. It was the browser whose icon was saved to the desktop of the Gateway 2000 (running Windows 98 SE) I had access to as a child. Since then, I’ve more or less used it as my daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want it to come across that I hate Mozilla. I mean, I do, but I haven’t always. As a teenager I donated to them regularly. I even printed out the little PDF they gave you that said “I’m a Mozilla supporter!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today’s Mozilla is not the Mozilla that it was twenty years ago. Or maybe it is, and I’m more just more tuned in now, or their actions are more egregious. Either way, they are not going to be the ones to save the open web. Using Firefox is not an act of defiance or a method for maintaining rending engine diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could spend time listing out Mozilla’s many sins. I could explain to you how they are a hype-driven advertisement company, who would sell out their users for a free Whopper at Burger King. I could bring up the dozens of instances of selling out their users’ privacy to make a quick buck, even while touting privacy as one of their defining values. I could mention the fact that they are a for-profit company pretending to be a nonprofit, or that they have squandered away half a billion dollars yearly with nothing to show for it exact a CEO making a multi-million dollar salary while Firefox withers on the vine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I won’t do that. You already know what they’ve done. You might not know every slight or offense, but you know enough to make a determination about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This organization is not worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inevitable question that then arises, of course, is “which browser should we use?” Chrome is proprietary, and has eaten most of the browser market. Brave is run by a homophobic, right-wing jackass, not to mention how it pushes a cryptocurrency scam on users every chance it gets. Besides, it’s more or less re-skinned Chrome, as are most other browsers you are thinking of: Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, take your pick. I know some folks will be screaming “just use a Firefox fork, like Waterfox!” I hate to break it to you all, but those forks mostly &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; features, they don’t add or maintain. If Firefox disappears tomorrow, they’ll disappear the day after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the solution? You’re not thinking big enough: the way we get browser diversity and “save the open web” is to actually diversify browsers! You don’t need one browser that runs on every device you use. It’s wild that folks want to use the same browser on Linux that they do on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and everywhere else you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you want is an open source rendering engine (ideally, several of them), and then platform-specific browsers that take advantage of the technologies of each system and lay those on top of a solid foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best browsing experience on GNOME is GNOME Web (occasional stability issues notwithstanding). The best browsing experience on macOS is Safari. Both of those use Webkit under the hood, but build their interfaces using platform-specific technologies like GTK and Adwaita to provide exceptional experiences (if you haven’t used GNOME Web in a while, try it — the trackpad support is incredible, the tab overviews and bookmarks are brilliant, it’s a great experience). I can imagine a future where there is a browser just for Windows, and one just for Android. Maybe they’ll use Webkit. Maybe Servo, once it’s ready. Or maybe another rendering engine will hit the scene that we’ve not even thought of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the open web is saved by a single browser or company. If it is, we are hopeless. I do believe we can get to a point with more browser diversity, more choices for rendering engines, and a healthier ecosystem overall. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; (an aspect of) how you save the open web.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jaded About Books</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/10/02/books.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/10/02/books.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Books can be amazing. A spectacular one can be life-changing. It remains the best option we have to getting into someone else’s head and letting their thoughts fill our minds for a while. And thanks to technologies such as e-readers and smart phones, people can now take their entire library with them everywhere they go. I’m certainly not knocking the medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have to admit that in recent months and years, I’ve become cynical and jaded about books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it started because of J.D. Vance. Years ago, all the buzz was about this “incredible” new book called &lt;em&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/em&gt;. It was being discussed on all the podcasts, and everyone who was everyone was reading it. As someone who actually grew up lower-class-ish in a poor area in the Appalachian mountains, I assumed it would resonate with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a hardcover copy, started reading it, and my god it was horrible. I could not get through the first few chapters. Nothing there resonated with me, and I found that I was having a hard time slogging through it. It wasn’t long until I abandoned the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly felt some measure of guilt over it. Was I broken? Am I stupid? Why wasn’t I getting anything out of it the way that other people were?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t realize at the time was that J.D. Vance, the author, was an alt-right douchebag who was working for a venture capital firm in silicon valley, and whose publishing was being artificially propped up by the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I stumbled on the essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elysian.press/p/no-one-buys-books&quot;&gt;“No one buys books”&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of the picture started to crystallize for me. The book market is a business, and in almost all cases, the only authors whose books make it to the public zeitgeist and on the shelves at your local book shops are the ones who can make money for the publishers. If you start out with a large audience, or your name is well-known, you can probably get your book published. Everyone else can kick rocks. Books don’t sell as much as you think, and if you aren’t able to market your book to your existing audience, you aren’t worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that famous YouTubers, TikTokers, and celebrities (or rather, their ghost-writers) can churn out books and make a reasonable profit, but they almost never have anything worthwhile to say. The authors with novel ideas, original writing, and a purpose? You’ll never even know they or their books exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now more forgiving to myself for not constantly having my nose in a book. I used to try to read x number of books a year, and would feel guilt for not achieving the goal. Now, I try to let things happen more naturally. There will be a handful of books that come onto my radar each year, written by someone thoughtful with something interesting to say. New non-fiction books from Cory Doctorow are always must-reads for me. Non-fiction in general, especially from not-well-known authors, are often worth picking up. And &lt;em&gt;Kitchen Confidential&lt;/em&gt; remains a yearly re-read. But the vast majority of what’s on the shelf? The paper would be better served as kindling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to discount &lt;em&gt;reading.&lt;/em&gt; I read all the time, and find it essential and enlightening. I think that blogs are probably the highest form of the written word, despite what snobs will tell you. Real people, living real lives, with thoughtful things to say, written at lengths long enough to cover the subject but short enough to be interesting. It’s the platonic idea of the written word, and there frankly aren’t enough in existence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>(Almost) Living the Dream</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/09/04/almost-living-the-dream.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/09/04/almost-living-the-dream.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about mobile computing even more than usual lately. For the past few years, and especially the last six months, I’ve found myself using my computer and all my digital content outside of my home more than ever before. For a period of time I was working partly from coffee shops and a small office at a coworking space I rented. Then, when I had my kidney transplant, I found myself living in the hospital for around four weeks, and then staying in a nearby hotel for two weeks. Then, for about a month or so after that, I was living part-time with my parents so my semi-retired mother could be an around-the-clock caregiver while my wife worked each day. And now, twelve hours per week, I find myself confined to a dialysis chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is to say, I spend a lot of time behind my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest source of frustration is, without question, power. Under typical use of web browsing and watching videos, I can squeak out almost four hours of use before the battery drains down to zero. I am constantly fighting with power. While in the hospital, there were times when I wasn’t near an outlet, or didn’t have anyone in the room with me who could help me connect to a power source. I have a large Anker power bank, but it is heavy, and I don’t always have a way of keeping it near me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, how I yearned for one of the M-series Macs during my hospital stay, with their legendary battery life. I would have been willing to switch to one temporarily, but I’m not willing to switch to one full-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, we’re closer than ever to having all-day battery life as table stakes for laptops. Between the new ARM-based Snapdragon processors that are starting to be the default for Windows laptops, or the new extremely powerful x86 chips that Intel announced this week, it’s just a matter of time before I will be able to buy a Linux-compatible laptop that has more power than I can realistically use, that will get me through an entire day from sun-up to sun-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the power use; I’m now reaching a point where everywhere I go, I can have everything I own with me. In my bag on any given day, I now carry with me every single book that I own, stored both on my laptop’s drive, as well as a Kobo ereader that provides month-long battery life and a tremendous reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every video game I own, or have ever owned, likewise travels with me and is playable on my laptop. I keep a small 8BitDo controller (in transparent Donkey Kong 64 jungle green) that I can connect wirelessly to play everything when I don’t want to use a keyboard. Some of the larger games take more horsepower than my aging laptop with integrated graphics can handle, but the new chips I mentioned promise to be able to handle those with ease. Even if they struggle today, it’s just a short matter of time before the chips out-pace the games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the proliferation of large SSDs, I carry every movie and TV show from my library around with me. A tiny 4TB SSD sits in a pocket, and can be connected any time I want to watch anything. With my next laptop, I’ll just get a 4TB (or larger?) drive, and keep everything on the internal storage. And improvements in video codecs, like H.265 and AV1, mean that I can keep Blu-ray and Ultra Blu-ray quality videos with me in a much smaller space footprint than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my music and photos also travel everywhere I go, but they have for years, so those aren’t worth writing home about as much. And of course, every document I’ve ever written, every digital project I’ve ever worked on. This might be the norm today, but it’s still worth marveling at what an achievement that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as for internet? I carry around an incredibly fast wireless access point, in the form of my cell phone and its built-in hotspot, everywhere I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to even mention my new home internet. In my teenage years, I seriously contemplated moving to Chattanooga, Tennessee. It wasn’t because I had visited before and loved the area (I would later visit in my late 20s, and did end up really enjoying myself), but rather because they were installing gigabit fiber, and I couldn’t imagine what life would be like with an internet connection that fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I didn’t have to move after all; gigabit fiber now runs directly to my house, and the speeds are almost life changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m amazed by the future. I carry a messenger bag, and in it, nearly every “possession” I own or care about accompanies me. I can’t wait to update this blog post in a year or two, removing the “almost” from the title. I’ll be able to say I have all-day battery life, can play every single game I want, and keep it all on a tiny drive built-in to my computer. But even today, I really am almost there, and it will never not feel like magic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When Kidney Transplants Go Wrong</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/08/28/when-kidney-transplants-go-wrong.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/08/28/when-kidney-transplants-go-wrong.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven’t spoken about this much publicly until now. I’ve posted about it off-and-on on Mastodon, but haven’t taken the time to really piece together the words that I want to share. The truth is, until recently, I don’t think I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have spoken much about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t aware, I received a kidney transplant on March 4th of this year. My incredible cousin, Cheryl, was fearless and unwavering in her desire to donate a kidney to me. Living donor kidneys are the holy grail for kidney patients: they have the fewest complications, the longest survival rates, and the overall best outcomes. Surgeons and doctors roll out the red carpet for these events. They are meticulous. The utmost care is taken to make sure nothing goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something went wrong. The evening after my transplant, it was already apparent something was wrong. I was &lt;em&gt;too tender&lt;/em&gt;. I had an ultrasound. I had, I think, another ultrasound. Nurses and doctors checked on me frequently. By morning, my surgeon was tired of waiting; she was certain — she knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rushed back to the OR, where it was confirmed I had a blood clot in my transplanted kidney. They had to take it out, flush it, and put it back in. This process is violent and shocking for the kidney. When it happens, they go to “sleep.” It was thought it would just take some time to wake up. A few days, maybe a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I couldn’t wait. I had to be put on continuous dialysis for a few days. I received blood transfusions. I had a central venous catheter installed, a set of tubes going into the veins and arteries around the heart, so I could receive ongoing dialysis treatments once I left the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days and weeks of waiting turned into months. I reached the point of no return, where they rule the kidney transplant a failure. &lt;em&gt;Patient graft non-function&lt;/em&gt;, the official designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did this happen? What went wrong? I don’t know, and I don’t think I’ll ever truly know. What I do know is there was nothing wrong with the kidney that my cousin donated. It was in perfect health. She is in perfect health. It was the most amazing gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem was the hospital decided to try a somewhat new technique involving a robot, of which I was the 7th or 8th person at Duke to have received this procedure. I’m told I’m still the only one for which this has not been a success. I’m also told that the kidney was larger than they expected when they actually got to it. I find this surprising since they had conducted imaging and knew the length of it precisely, but they had to go back and make our incisions larger than planned to make the switch. Perhaps that had something to do with it. Or maybe, and most probably, it just comes down to bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one immutable truth about the universe, it’s that shit happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds of this particular complication happening are a fraction of a percent. It’s really a statistical anomaly; and the odds of it happening again, I am reassuringly informed, are astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now back on the transplant list. I’m receiving dialysis twelve hours per week, rising in the early morning hours to make a 5:30am chair time. If no new donors come forward, I will have to wait until another kidney becomes available from a deceased donor, something that will likely take a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few bright spots. One is, despite the anti-rejection meds I’m still taking (we don’t want to build up antibodies for the new kidney, even though it’s not working — it might jeopardize the success of the next one), the hemodialysis I’m on has me feeling much like my old self again. I have more energy, more pizzazz, more mental sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other bright spot is, Duke University Hospital is now part of the national kidney donor registry, which opens up the possibility of a paired exchange. With a paired exchange, I no longer need a donor who is geographically close to me or Duke Hospital. I also don’t have to find someone with an ideal match for my kidney. In both cases, someone wanting to donate to me could donate their kidney, and it would go to someone in need that is a good match for them in their local area; in return, I am moved to the front of the list and will receive a living donor kidney from someone else doing a paired exchange in the same way (who is a good match for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is to say, if you’ve ever considered a life-changing kidney donation but have been put off for any reason (being too far away, being older or younger than me, being larger or smaller than me, different blood types, etc.), almost all of those barriers have been broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in exploring possibilities for donation, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://duke.donorscreen.org/register/now&quot;&gt;register here&lt;/a&gt; to start the screening process to see if you would be a good fit for donation. Of course, there is no expectation, nor obligation. Giving up a kidney is a huge, huge sacrifice, and involves a surgical procedure; it’s not something I take lightly or take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I can’t thank everyone enough for how supportive they were during the first transplant, and the difficult weeks following it. I received so many cards, so many kind gifts and love offerings, and an absolute torrent of well wishes and prayers. Thanks to my family for taking care of me for many, many weeks, thanks to my coworkers for keeping things afloat in my absence, and thanks especially to my cousin for the greatest gift I could ever receive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where Are the Open Cricut Alternatives?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/07/17/open-cricut-alternatives.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/07/17/open-cricut-alternatives.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarysue.com/the-sticker-mule-email-explained/&quot;&gt;StickerMule sent out a bizarre email to its customers&lt;/a&gt; calling for everyone to dial the political hatred back, and stating that many in the company (including/especially the CEO) are staunch Trump supporters and have been afraid to be vocal about this support for fear of being ostracized. Anyone with half a brain could predict how this would go, and now I’m seeing lots of suggestions floating by on Mastodon for competing companies who support more progressive causes (or at a minimum, I suppose, don’t &lt;em&gt;openly&lt;/em&gt; support a fascist candidate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conducting business with companies that are more aligned with your own values and principles is essential, I must admit that I’m surprised that so many in the do-it-yourself/hacktivist/maker communities don’t want to just roll up their sleeves and make these stickers themselves. The materials and tools for this are out there and readily available. I wouldn’t call them affordable, but they aren’t any more expensive than even the most inexpensive 3D printer, and the sticker paper is far cheaper than even a single spool of 3D filament. So why are so many in the free software/open source communities enthralled with 3D printing, but not with computer-controlled cutting machines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it comes down to the market being almost entirely owned by one brand of cutter, namely Cricut. Cricut is a commercial machine, and the software necessary to control it (“Design Space”) is entirely proprietary and only works on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS. Not only that, but to actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the software you are limited to only 20 new designs per month. More than that, and Cricut expects you to open up your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It boggles my mind that there isn’t a good alternative to the Cricut machines, let alone ones that work with Linux and are generally more open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cricut, in many ways, radiates with the same energy as 3D printing, yet the latter seems to have a more prominent space in the hearts and minds of tech enthusiasts. I might argue, with absolutely no evidence to back up said argument, that there are more useful things that can be made with a Cricut-like device for most day-to-day needs than a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious benefit of a Cricut is that you can design and print your own stickers. Pretty much every dyed in the wool geek I know, save for the most hardcore minimalists, adorn their various systems with as many stickers as they can get their hands on. By being able to print your own vinyl stickers, you can rep a plethora of projects, apps, and services. I can also see this being a potential (albeit small) revenue stream for projects. Rather than partnering with another company to make stickers, or getting them produced in bulk, you can do on-demand printing of swag and have a higher profit margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from stickers, I can imagine lots of other uses folks might get out of a cutting machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customized labels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T-Shirts (iron-on)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coffee mugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, they can be handy for making the sort of swag that you would sell in a merch store or give away at conferences so folks can represent or get the word out for your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we get more open cutting machines? I don’t know, I’m doing the thing where you ask the question with no idea how to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; pull it off. I imagine that the answer lies in some combination of reverse-engineering the protocols that the proprietary applications use to talk with existing machines, and then creating a competing piece of software. That would at least let you control the machines out there on the market. That doesn’t help with the overall marketshare issue. The solution there, I imagine, involves hardware hackers building their own bespoke prototypes and sharing their builds. Maybe it even involves existing hardware makers (I’m thinking 3D printer manufacturers like Prusa or Creality) expanding their offerings to include cutters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it takes, I really hope to see the market expand beyond Cricut. A little competition could only be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Love 3D Printing, I Hate 3D Printing</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/07/15/3d-printers.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/07/15/3d-printers.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find myself yet again faced with another move, and am naturally contemplating once more the physical things in my life. Every single move results in fewer and fewer things making the journey.  I suspect that after this one I’ll have almost nothing left. I’ve been a minimalist for a long time, and I grow only more resolute in my leanings every time I have to hoist another box and lug it across town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The item I’m struggling with most right now is my 3D printer. I purchased a 3D printer back in 2020, right at the beginning of the pandemic. While some people set their attention on sour dough starters (okay, I’ll admit, I dipped my toe in that water as well), I spent more of my free time and energy exploring the world of 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the tin, 3D printing should be something I love. Conceptually, I find it beautiful: the idea that physical objects, much like their digital counterparts, can be dreamed up by anyone with the right set of tools and personal know-how, transmitted instantaneously and shared with everyone on the planet, free of charge, and that the person on the other end of the screen can will something into existence with the press of just a few buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is genuinely magical and liberating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I put on my curmudgeon hat and view my printing history over the past four years, I must confront a difficult fact: I haven’t really printed anything &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;, nor anything that has really stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, at least from where I’m standing, consumer 3D printers aren’t all that useful at spitting out truly helpful, long-lasting things. Most of what they generate is just cheap plastic, something that will break quickly, or be tossed out. They’re great for making trinkets and tchotchkes, but I don’t need any more of those. I really don’t need any &lt;em&gt;all all&lt;/em&gt;, come to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 3D printers can be a massive ballache. Bed leveling issues, filament issues, build plate issues, poor adhesion, wrong temperatures for the given material, stringing, you name it — the list goes on and on. I’m constantly watching, adjusting, tweaking, fiddling, and correcting it seems. But I can’t deny the joy of prying off a really great print from the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my wife, very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of the minimalist persuasion, adores when I print things for her. That alone makes the decision more difficult, and I suspect may sway the final vote in a different direction than it otherwise might go were I a single man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ultimately, I’m not sure if my 3D printer will make the move with me. Its fate is as of yet undecided.  But every day I look at it, whimpering in the corner, with contempt and derision, plotting how I might offload it onto some unsuspecting budding hobbyist.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On the Demise of Physical Media</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/02/24/physical-media.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/02/24/physical-media.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of folks in my online circles are lamenting the inevitable decline of physical media. I myself have shared similar sentiments, so I can’t blame anyone for feeling this way. My local Best Buy is in the process of completely clearing out the DVD and Blu-ray section, Target’s DVD isle has been replaced with books, and Walmart is starting to pull physical Xbox games (at Microsoft’s request). My gut reaction is to be sad about this, but the more I think about it, the more I think that our collective sadness about the loss of physical media may be misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of the strong belief that digital downloads and streaming aren’t the problem; it’s the digital rights management (DRM) that’s the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I had only one future ambition: &lt;em&gt;when I grow up&lt;/em&gt;, I told myself, &lt;em&gt;I want to own a copy of every movie and TV show I like!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, that goal seems quaint and easily achievable. What you have to understand is that, as a young person, I had very little money and each video I would purchase was a huge investment. The thought of being able to have a copy of everything seemed like such a far-off dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up wearing VHS tapes completely out, constantly keeping them on repeat on my TV (complete with built-in VCR). I would watch my movies time after time after time, until they would barely play in the tape deck any more. When DVDs came out I got a DVD player for Christmas (a bulky, heavy beast of a video player), and would watch movies on repeat until I had memorized every line. I can still quote the majority of &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/em&gt; by heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In adulthood, I don’t watch movies and TV with the same intensity or obsession as my younger self (I’m just too busy and don’t have the attention span that I used to). But I still love building and maintaining a media collection, and still regularly watch content from my library. I have hundreds of discs, ranging from 4K Blu-rays to DVD box sets, and everything in between. When given the option, I still buy a physical copy of everything I want to own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t do this because I specifically want a a physical copy of each film or TV show. What I love most about my movie collection isn’t that the majority of it is tangible. Having a digital movie stored on a round disc that I pop into the player isn’t especially important to me. What is important is the ability to watch my content wherever I want. As a Linux user for the past decade and a half, I’ve had to deal with issue after issue of not having content available to me. If I purchase a video from Apple TV (formerly iTunes), it will only play on Apple Devices, or devices that are compatible with the DRM scheme that they use. This rules out my laptop, which is my primary method of viewing content. It also limits me in terms of the types of set-top boxes I can connect directly to my TV. The same goes for other providers as well, such as Google/YouTube (they artificially limit the resolution to 720p for TV shows and 480p for movies), or Amazon (movies are limited to 480p there as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people enjoy the experience of physical media. They like organizing it and displaying it on shelves, they like looking through their collection to decide what to watch, and they like the act of physically loading a player with a copy of something. For those people, this sadness is perfectly placed. A purely digital experience, where everything is delivered electronically over the internet, will never replicate that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me at least, it isn’t the physical copy that I’m wanting, it’s the accessibility and freedom that a physical copy affords. It’s being able to watch the video on my laptop, or my phone, or a homemade media center (such as LibreELEC). It’s being able to lend a copy to a family member, and being able to put it into a video editor so I can make short clips, or turn them into GIFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I don’t really need or want a disc; I just want a file. A file that is not encumbered with DRM. A file that I can copy and backup, and generally exercise a modicum of control over. There have been plenty of instances of movie studios going back in and editing releases, and only making the modified versions available. Right now, physical copies are the best way to preserve original versions, but as long as you are able to store and preserve a digital file containing the original versions, there’s no reason why those can’t persist. In just about every scenario, the benefits of owning a physical copy don’t come down to the physicality of the item, but instead what you are able to practically do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say there aren’t benefits to a physical copy, beyond what you get out of just having a file. Being able to sell your unwanted media or purchase used media at a discounted rate is the biggest one I can think of. There are also cases to be made about exclusive bonus features that are only released on physical disc (although there’s no reason why this sort of content can’t be distributed digitally). But there are downsides, too. Physical discs take up a lot of storage space in your home. They are also prone to being lost or damaged, and even suffer from natural degradation over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, if I had my druthers, I’d keep physical media around forever. I must admit, though, that once physical media is gone, I won’t be sad. In most cases, the internet is a much better distribution method. File storage is cheap and getting cheaper. SSDs are getting bigger and bigger (so are hard disks, but I’ve had too many awful experiences with them to trust them any more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Times change, technology improves, and people vote with their dollars. There is a clear and obvious preference for digital downloads and streaming, whether we like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s the right fight for us to try and keep physical copies around forever. The right fight, the better fight, is against restrictive DRM.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cutting it Off and Feeling Nothing</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/02/19/feeling-nothing.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/02/19/feeling-nothing.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a line from the movie 500 Days of Summer that often plays in my head. The clip is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/hair.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but for those not wanting to watch a 20 second video, it involves a narrator telling us a little bit about the personality of a woman named Summer, in which he describes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since the disintegration of her parents marriage, she’d only loved two things: the first was her long, dark hair; and the second was how easily she could cut it off and feel nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was incredibly sentimental. Any time I was given a gift by someone, or any time I felt that something I owned was of unique importance, it was nearly impossible for me to get rid of it. It felt like a betrayal of trust, or a denial of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I’ve decidedly grown out of since then. Now, I find that with only the rarest of exceptions, I can mercilessly whittle down my personal collection of things without any hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within recent memory, I moved homes three time within a single year. Each time, fewer things made the trip. After the third move, it became an obsession of mine to remove as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, this past year, that drive kicked in harder and more forcefully than ever before. Starting home dialysis meant that I was suddenly inundated with hundreds of boxes of things that I needed to survive. I suppose the drive to remove all other non-essentials was a result of all that being foisted upon me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to get rid of everything I own, and there are still some things that mean a great deal to me. But by and large, I have trimmed all of my excess possessions, and am enjoying a leaner lifestyle with the handful of things I choose to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say, I’ve been a minimalist for a while, and that feeling has only grown over the past half decade. Much like Summer, I’m proud of how much I can cut things out, and feel nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kidney Transplant</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/02/15/kidney-transplant.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/02/15/kidney-transplant.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having spent lo these many years being an unabashed proponent of the “right to repair”, I’ve decided the time has come to put my money where my mouth is and apply those principles for myself in the most literal sense by swapping out a major organ. Thankfully, the part is standardized, and the repair guide is widely available for professionals in the field. Although I’m a big believer in getting your hands dirty and not being afraid to attempt a repair on your own, I think it best to leave this one to the experts. Unfortunately, the supply chain isn’t ideal, so acquiring replacement parts is a challenge. Thankfully, an incredibly kind soul has come forward to offer me a compatible part, at no charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I’m relieved, excited, nervous, and most of all, grateful, to say that I’ll be receiving a kidney transplant in just a couple weeks time. Out of respect to the donor’s privacy I won’t mention who is donating or their connection to me (just in case they want to remain anonymous), but this is such a selfless and enormous gift that I sometimes get choked up just thinking about it. I will never be able to thank them enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surgery I’ll be having will be done using a relatively new technique, involving robotics. I’ll be just one of a half dozen or so patients to have received this specific procedure. Once I’m out of surgery I’ll stay in the hospital for several days, will remain near the hospital for an additional week, and then will return home for another couple months of recovery (with frequent follow-up trips to make sure things keep working as expected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, a new chapter of my life will begin. There will be lots of lifestyle changes as a result, but many of them for the better. I’m excited to have more energy, more personal time, and more freedom to travel, spend time with friends and family, and be more involved in projects that matter to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made it 29 years on these two kidneys, but they’ve done all they came here to do. I’ll be turning 30 with a new kidney, a new perspective, and in many ways, a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Party</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/08/21/the-party.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/08/21/the-party.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, my eGFR number dropped to 13, placing me firmly in the “Stage 5 Kidney Disease” camp. I’m now essentially waiting for kidney failure, while trying to figure out what’s next for me in terms of treatment options (I suspect dialysis in the near future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to be morbid or dramatic, but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about this for the past week. Even though I’m going to be fine, I can’t stop thinking about the fact that I’m dying. Without medical intervention, I will be dead in just a short while. It’s &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once heard a quote, which to me perfectly encapsulates everything I’m feeling and thinking. Christopher Hitchens once remarked, “it will happen to all of us, that at some point you get tapped on the shoulder and told, not just that the party’s over, but slightly worse: the party’s going on — but you have to leave. And it’s going on without you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the hardest thought, to me at least. There’s so much more that I want to do in my life. So much more I want to see, to experience, to be a part of, to help shape. The party is going on; and although I know I’ll never see the end of it, I want to catch as much of it as possible. I’m just not ready to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zen and the Art of Actual Maintenance</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/06/25/zen-and-the-art-of-actual-maintenance.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/06/25/zen-and-the-art-of-actual-maintenance.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, I finally crossed a task off my to-do list that goes back half a decade and more failed attempts than I can count on one hand: I finally finished reading all of &lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zen&lt;/em&gt; is, without a doubt, the most frustrating book I’ve ever read. It’s frustrating because the first couple chapters feel as if the book was written specifically for me. Every word that is written connects with me on some level. I love the travel story, the father and son tale, the technical aspects that are specific to wrenching on a motorcycle, and the deeper ruminations of what it means to maintain something and the role that technology plays in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the multiple attempts at reading this book, I’ve flagged or highlighted the following sentences (which you’ll note, with just one exception, are all within the first 50 pages of the book):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You see things vacationing  on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other. In a car you’re always in a compartment, and because you’re used to it you don’t realize that through the car window everything you see is just more TV.” (pg 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Plans are deliberately indefinite, more to travel than to arrive anywhere.” (pg 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It seems natural and normal to me to make use of the small tool kits and instruction booklets supplied with each machine, and keep it tuned and adjusted myself. “ (pg 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about about it and want to get on to other things.” (pg 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is impractical, but practicality isn’t the whole thing with gloves or with anything else.” (pg 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Each machine has its own unique personality which probably could be defined as the intuitive sum total of everything you know and feel about it.” (pg 50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it’s a little better to travel than to arrive.” (pg 119)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These, I believe, illustrative the kind of book I wanted to read. One with little quips about the nature of keeping things running, of taking care of equipment, of being a custodian. And along the way, collecting pearls of wisdom about seeing the world, living deliberately, and taking the slow path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world, I am kind of obsessed with maintenance. I experience the zen of maintenance nearly every day. Nothing brings me more pleasure than fixing something that’s broken, or performing little tasks to make things work better or last longer. I am proud of the things I own and the things I have made, and show that appreciation by tending to their care. I had hoped to find a kindred spirit here with the author. And it started out so strong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, at this point in the book, the author manages to crawl up his own ass so far that the text becomes unreadable. It’s a miserable, tedious slog in which the author spends his time talking about how brilliant he is (or at least, an older version of himself before he drove himself to a mental breakdown) for coming up with a grand theory of “quality”, and how everything relates to quality. He tells of how he taught this in school, tirelessly recounts arguments and discussions he’s had about it with former students, and beats you over the head with it without actually saying anything substantive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every sentence he writes is trying to make you think he’s a genius. Nobody will ever be as impressed at his intelligence as much as he is. Each sentence, each chapter, grows more frustrating to read. In between these rambling bursts, you get treated to anecdotes of him being a really grumpy, awful father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, out of nowhere, Chapter 26 happens. And what a lovely, glorious chapter it is. Here, the author takes a break from talking about quality and focuses on a new word: gumption. Only this time, I think he really does have some interesting things to say about gumption. What it is. Why it’s necessary. Ways to increase it. Things that can cause it to dwindle. Real, practical advice, and often wrapped around various maintenance-related concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 26 is frustrating because it’s so good. This is the book I wanted to read! I wanted all 400 pages to be like this! I know this type of content is available, and within the author’s capabilities, and now more than ever I’m convinced the author is deliberating trying to torture me. What a tease!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As quickly as Chapter 26 arrives, it’s gone. Back to talking about quality. Back to trying to sound smarter than everyone else in the room. Back to referencing the greeks and debating himself over various schools of thought. It’s so tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I’m glad I finally finished it. Some might argue it was a waste of time, or that it’s best not to force yourself to continue reading something if you’re not enjoying it. I do generally agree with that; life’s short. But for me, this was a personal struggle that had bested me for the better part of a decade. If nothing else, I proved something about myself. I’m a little older, a little wiser, and more determined than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linkbuds Review</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/06/24/linkbuds.html</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been dealing with severe dizziness and nausea episodes for the past few months. Although not a constant issue (most days, anyway), when one of the dizziness spells happens it’s completely debilitating for at least a few hours. I’m still in the process of determining why these issues are happening (I’ve had MRIs, angiograms, and echocardiagrams, and so far everything is checking out okay - waiting for an ENT appointment next month), but in the interim, I’m trying to do all I can to prevent the episodes from happening, and trying to reduce the severity when they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be related to issues with my ears. For several weeks, I had a significant ear infection that took a while to resolve. They gave me antibiotics, and I’m already on steroids for my kidney disease, but on first glance they didn’t seem to correct the issue. Even after the antibiotics, the infection remained. Thankfully, that at least has cleared up in recent days. I suspect that it cleared up not only as a result of those medications, but also due to some lifestyle changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try and get ahead of the issue, I decided to stop wearing headphones and earbuds as much as possible. Between the pressure inside my ears, and the hot and sweaty feeling of my ears not being able to vent to the outside air while wearing them, I came to the conclusion that the earbud use was negatively affecting my ears and, by extension, my dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the decrease in usage, I’ve noticed a significant improvement not only in terms of the number of episodes I experience, but generally in just how my ears and sinuses feel. My ears feel so much better! The problem is, I really, really missed being able to listen to audio privately. I have a few Bluetooth speakers around my home and office, but I don’t like to disturb my partner or others at my coworking space, so I find that I am only able to use them occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to find another solution, I began to search the web for options. The most prevalent option I saw that might avoid the issues cause by headphones and earbuds were bone-conducting headphones. These are headphones that physically make contact with the side of your head, and channel the sound through the bones in your skull (staying outside of your ear canal). I’ve tried them in the past, but never liked them. They never got loud enough for me, and they always made my teeth feel like I was chewing on aluminum foil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I remembered a design for a set of earbuds I had seen a while ago. This is where the Sony Linkbuds come in. Sony Linkbuds are unique and somewhat strange. They are earbuds, but they don’t fit inside your ear canal. They rest right at the entrance, forming a small ring (almost like a donut) around the ear canal but never going in. They’re also, oddly enough, completely open in the middle. It’s strange to think of an “open back” earbud, but that’s what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your point of view, the downside of this is that you don’t get any noise cancellation or sound isolation. The sounds in your environment are still noticeable with them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it can also be a plus. Rather than the “transparency modes” of most noise canceling headphones, which essentially “pipe in” the sounds from outside, you’re getting the sounds directly and authentically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, most important of all, there is no feeling of pressure like with the other earbuds. There’s nothing in your canal, and nothing plugging anything up. You get sound, you get airflow, and your ears can breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are incredibly comfortable to wear. I could do with them being one notch louder, but they get plenty loud enough. And the sound is pretty good. They’re not as good in the sound department as noise-canceling earbuds, but you can’t expect them to be. And the health and lifestyle benefits you get in return are well worth that trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you, like me, find yourself having issues with normal earbuds and headphones, it may be worth giving the Linkbuds a try. I’m absolutely loving mine, and am overjoyed to be able to go about my day listening to music and podcasts again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nalgene Bottles</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/06/11/nalgene.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/06/11/nalgene.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple really nice water bottles: stainless steel, dual-walled with a vacuum to act as an insulator, and thick screw-on caps to keep leaks contained and prevent evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they don’t hold a candle to my Nalgene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my Nalgene water bottle for reasons that I’ve had a hard time pinpointing. Some of them are based on concrete facts. Others, I think, purely come down to personal preference and opinion. The truth is that, for whatever reason (I have speculations), when I drink out of a Nalgene, I drink more water throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stewing on it for a bit, I think I’ve figured out most of the reasons why I find the Nalgene to be the supreme portable water vessel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s easy to keep track of the amount of water you’re drinking. The material is transparent and has markings on the outside to show how much water is left in the bottle. And, best of all, it shows not only U.S. imperial measurements but metric as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The wide mouth makes it easier to fill, easier to drink out of, and more easily accommodates ice for times when you want it as cold as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re dishwasher safe and can just be chucked into the top rack at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are inexpensive and understated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s almost impossible to lose the cap, because it’s attached with a strap. If you do, you can always get a replacement strap (&lt;a href=&quot;%5B%3Chttps://www.printables.com/model/263684-nalgene-bottle-strap%3E%5D(%3Chttps://www.printables.com/model/263684-nalgene-bottle-strap%3E)&quot;&gt;or 3D print your own&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are ludicrously durable. They are almost impossible to kill. You can drop them from great heights, or onto traditionally unforgiving ground (looking at you, concrete), yet they almost always bounce off. And, over time, the scuffs and scratches just give it a charming patina.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a community of people who make cool stuff for Nalgenes. Because the sizes are consistent (I hesitate to call them “standardized”), it’s easy to find accessories or even 3D print them. My favorites include adapters for car cup holders so they can fit the wider bottles, as well as bicycle water cages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In that vein, they’re great for customization purposes! They come in a wide variety of colors (including bottles, straps, and lids), so it’s easy to find something that suits your preferences and tells the world a little about you. You can also cover them in stickers (just don’t run it through the dishwasher if you do).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This isn’t something I personally have used, but I know they’re loved for being very versatile. The measurements on the side make them suitable for use in measuring and storing a plethora of ingredients. And, because they’re BPA free and have a melting point above the boiling point of water, it’s safe to store hot water in them if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s to you, Nalgene bottle! Thanks for keeping me hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
