        <title>(Almost) Living the Dream</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/09/04/almost-living-the-dream.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/09/04/almost-living-the-dream.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about mobile computing even more than usual lately. For the past few years, and especially the last six months, I’ve found myself using my computer and all my digital content outside of my home more than ever before. For a period of time I was working partly from coffee shops and a small office at a coworking space I rented. Then, when I had my kidney transplant, I found myself living in the hospital for around four weeks, and then staying in a nearby hotel for two weeks. Then, for about a month or so after that, I was living part-time with my parents so my semi-retired mother could be an around-the-clock caregiver while my wife worked each day. And now, twelve hours per week, I find myself confined to a dialysis chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is to say, I spend a lot of time behind my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest source of frustration is, without question, power. Under typical use of web browsing and watching videos, I can squeak out almost four hours of use before the battery drains down to zero. I am constantly fighting with power. While in the hospital, there were times when I wasn’t near an outlet, or didn’t have anyone in the room with me who could help me connect to a power source. I have a large Anker power bank, but it is heavy, and I don’t always have a way of keeping it near me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, how I yearned for one of the M-series Macs during my hospital stay, with their legendary battery life. I would have been willing to switch to one temporarily, but I’m not willing to switch to one full-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, we’re closer than ever to having all-day battery life as table stakes for laptops. Between the new ARM-based Snapdragon processors that are starting to be the default for Windows laptops, or the new extremely powerful x86 chips that Intel announced this week, it’s just a matter of time before I will be able to buy a Linux-compatible laptop that has more power than I can realistically use, that will get me through an entire day from sun-up to sun-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the power use; I’m now reaching a point where everywhere I go, I can have everything I own with me. In my bag on any given day, I now carry with me every single book that I own, stored both on my laptop’s drive, as well as a Kobo ereader that provides month-long battery life and a tremendous reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every video game I own, or have ever owned, likewise travels with me and is playable on my laptop. I keep a small 8BitDo controller (in transparent Donkey Kong 64 jungle green) that I can connect wirelessly to play everything when I don’t want to use a keyboard. Some of the larger games take more horsepower than my aging laptop with integrated graphics can handle, but the new chips I mentioned promise to be able to handle those with ease. Even if they struggle today, it’s just a short matter of time before the chips out-pace the games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the proliferation of large SSDs, I carry every movie and TV show from my library around with me. A tiny 4TB SSD sits in a pocket, and can be connected any time I want to watch anything. With my next laptop, I’ll just get a 4TB (or larger?) drive, and keep everything on the internal storage. And improvements in video codecs, like H.265 and AV1, mean that I can keep Blu-ray and Ultra Blu-ray quality videos with me in a much smaller space footprint than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my music and photos also travel everywhere I go, but they have for years, so those aren’t worth writing home about as much. And of course, every document I’ve ever written, every digital project I’ve ever worked on. This might be the norm today, but it’s still worth marveling at what an achievement that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as for internet? I carry around an incredibly fast wireless access point, in the form of my cell phone and its built-in hotspot, everywhere I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to even mention my new home internet. In my teenage years, I seriously contemplated moving to Chattanooga, Tennessee. It wasn’t because I had visited before and loved the area (I would later visit in my late 20s, and did end up really enjoying myself), but rather because they were installing gigabit fiber, and I couldn’t imagine what life would be like with an internet connection that fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I didn’t have to move after all; gigabit fiber now runs directly to my house, and the speeds are almost life changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m amazed by the future. I carry a messenger bag, and in it, nearly every “possession” I own or care about accompanies me. I can’t wait to update this blog post in a year or two, removing the “almost” from the title. I’ll be able to say I have all-day battery life, can play every single game I want, and keep it all on a tiny drive built-in to my computer. But even today, I really am almost there, and it will never not feel like magic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When Kidney Transplants Go Wrong</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/08/28/when-kidney-transplants-go-wrong.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/08/28/when-kidney-transplants-go-wrong.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven’t spoken about this much publicly until now. I’ve posted about it off-and-on on Mastodon, but haven’t taken the time to really piece together the words that I want to share. The truth is, until recently, I don’t think I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have spoken much about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t aware, I received a kidney transplant on March 4th of this year. My incredible cousin, Cheryl, was fearless and unwavering in her desire to donate a kidney to me. Living donor kidneys are the holy grail for kidney patients: they have the fewest complications, the longest survival rates, and the overall best outcomes. Surgeons and doctors roll out the red carpet for these events. They are meticulous. The utmost care is taken to make sure nothing goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something went wrong. The evening after my transplant, it was already apparent something was wrong. I was &lt;em&gt;too tender&lt;/em&gt;. I had an ultrasound. I had, I think, another ultrasound. Nurses and doctors checked on me frequently. By morning, my surgeon was tired of waiting; she was certain — she knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rushed back to the OR, where it was confirmed I had a blood clot in my transplanted kidney. They had to take it out, flush it, and put it back in. This process is violent and shocking for the kidney. When it happens, they go to “sleep.” It was thought it would just take some time to wake up. A few days, maybe a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I couldn’t wait. I had to be put on continuous dialysis for a few days. I received blood transfusions. I had a central venous catheter installed, a set of tubes going into the veins and arteries around the heart, so I could receive ongoing dialysis treatments once I left the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days and weeks of waiting turned into months. I reached the point of no return, where they rule the kidney transplant a failure. &lt;em&gt;Patient graft non-function&lt;/em&gt;, the official designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did this happen? What went wrong? I don’t know, and I don’t think I’ll ever truly know. What I do know is there was nothing wrong with the kidney that my cousin donated. It was in perfect health. She is in perfect health. It was the most amazing gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem was the hospital decided to try a somewhat new technique involving a robot, of which I was the 7th or 8th person at Duke to have received this procedure. I’m told I’m still the only one for which this has not been a success. I’m also told that the kidney was larger than they expected when they actually got to it. I find this surprising since they had conducted imaging and knew the length of it precisely, but they had to go back and make our incisions larger than planned to make the switch. Perhaps that had something to do with it. Or maybe, and most probably, it just comes down to bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one immutable truth about the universe, it’s that shit happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds of this particular complication happening are a fraction of a percent. It’s really a statistical anomaly; and the odds of it happening again, I am reassuringly informed, are astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now back on the transplant list. I’m receiving dialysis twelve hours per week, rising in the early morning hours to make a 5:30am chair time. If no new donors come forward, I will have to wait until another kidney becomes available from a deceased donor, something that will likely take a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few bright spots. One is, despite the anti-rejection meds I’m still taking (we don’t want to build up antibodies for the new kidney, even though it’s not working — it might jeopardize the success of the next one), the hemodialysis I’m on has me feeling much like my old self again. I have more energy, more pizzazz, more mental sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other bright spot is, Duke University Hospital is now part of the national kidney donor registry, which opens up the possibility of a paired exchange. With a paired exchange, I no longer need a donor who is geographically close to me or Duke Hospital. I also don’t have to find someone with an ideal match for my kidney. In both cases, someone wanting to donate to me could donate their kidney, and it would go to someone in need that is a good match for them in their local area; in return, I am moved to the front of the list and will receive a living donor kidney from someone else doing a paired exchange in the same way (who is a good match for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is to say, if you’ve ever considered a life-changing kidney donation but have been put off for any reason (being too far away, being older or younger than me, being larger or smaller than me, different blood types, etc.), almost all of those barriers have been broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in exploring possibilities for donation, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://duke.donorscreen.org/register/now&quot;&gt;register here&lt;/a&gt; to start the screening process to see if you would be a good fit for donation. Of course, there is no expectation, nor obligation. Giving up a kidney is a huge, huge sacrifice, and involves a surgical procedure; it’s not something I take lightly or take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I can’t thank everyone enough for how supportive they were during the first transplant, and the difficult weeks following it. I received so many cards, so many kind gifts and love offerings, and an absolute torrent of well wishes and prayers. Thanks to my family for taking care of me for many, many weeks, thanks to my coworkers for keeping things afloat in my absence, and thanks especially to my cousin for the greatest gift I could ever receive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where Are the Open Cricut Alternatives?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/07/17/open-cricut-alternatives.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/07/17/open-cricut-alternatives.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarysue.com/the-sticker-mule-email-explained/&quot;&gt;StickerMule sent out a bizarre email to its customers&lt;/a&gt; calling for everyone to dial the political hatred back, and stating that many in the company (including/especially the CEO) are staunch Trump supporters and have been afraid to be vocal about this support for fear of being ostracized. Anyone with half a brain could predict how this would go, and now I’m seeing lots of suggestions floating by on Mastodon for competing companies who support more progressive causes (or at a minimum, I suppose, don’t &lt;em&gt;openly&lt;/em&gt; support a fascist candidate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conducting business with companies that are more aligned with your own values and principles is essential, I must admit that I’m surprised that so many in the do-it-yourself/hacktivist/maker communities don’t want to just roll up their sleeves and make these stickers themselves. The materials and tools for this are out there and readily available. I wouldn’t call them affordable, but they aren’t any more expensive than even the most inexpensive 3D printer, and the sticker paper is far cheaper than even a single spool of 3D filament. So why are so many in the free software/open source communities enthralled with 3D printing, but not with computer-controlled cutting machines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it comes down to the market being almost entirely owned by one brand of cutter, namely Cricut. Cricut is a commercial machine, and the software necessary to control it (“Design Space”) is entirely proprietary and only works on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS. Not only that, but to actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the software you are limited to only 20 new designs per month. More than that, and Cricut expects you to open up your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It boggles my mind that there isn’t a good alternative to the Cricut machines, let alone ones that work with Linux and are generally more open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cricut, in many ways, radiates with the same energy as 3D printing, yet the latter seems to have a more prominent space in the hearts and minds of tech enthusiasts. I might argue, with absolutely no evidence to back up said argument, that there are more useful things that can be made with a Cricut-like device for most day-to-day needs than a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious benefit of a Cricut is that you can design and print your own stickers. Pretty much every dyed in the wool geek I know, save for the most hardcore minimalists, adorn their various systems with as many stickers as they can get their hands on. By being able to print your own vinyl stickers, you can rep a plethora of projects, apps, and services. I can also see this being a potential (albeit small) revenue stream for projects. Rather than partnering with another company to make stickers, or getting them produced in bulk, you can do on-demand printing of swag and have a higher profit margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from stickers, I can imagine lots of other uses folks might get out of a cutting machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customized labels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T-Shirts (iron-on)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coffee mugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, they can be handy for making the sort of swag that you would sell in a merch store or give away at conferences so folks can represent or get the word out for your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we get more open cutting machines? I don’t know, I’m doing the thing where you ask the question with no idea how to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; pull it off. I imagine that the answer lies in some combination of reverse-engineering the protocols that the proprietary applications use to talk with existing machines, and then creating a competing piece of software. That would at least let you control the machines out there on the market. That doesn’t help with the overall marketshare issue. The solution there, I imagine, involves hardware hackers building their own bespoke prototypes and sharing their builds. Maybe it even involves existing hardware makers (I’m thinking 3D printer manufacturers like Prusa or Creality) expanding their offerings to include cutters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it takes, I really hope to see the market expand beyond Cricut. A little competition could only be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Love 3D Printing, I Hate 3D Printing</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/07/15/3d-printers.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/07/15/3d-printers.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find myself yet again faced with another move, and am naturally contemplating once more the physical things in my life. Every single move results in fewer and fewer things making the journey.  I suspect that after this one I’ll have almost nothing left. I’ve been a minimalist for a long time, and I grow only more resolute in my leanings every time I have to hoist another box and lug it across town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The item I’m struggling with most right now is my 3D printer. I purchased a 3D printer back in 2020, right at the beginning of the pandemic. While some people set their attention on sour dough starters (okay, I’ll admit, I dipped my toe in that water as well), I spent more of my free time and energy exploring the world of 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the tin, 3D printing should be something I love. Conceptually, I find it beautiful: the idea that physical objects, much like their digital counterparts, can be dreamed up by anyone with the right set of tools and personal know-how, transmitted instantaneously and shared with everyone on the planet, free of charge, and that the person on the other end of the screen can will something into existence with the press of just a few buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is genuinely magical and liberating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I put on my curmudgeon hat and view my printing history over the past four years, I must confront a difficult fact: I haven’t really printed anything &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;, nor anything that has really stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, at least from where I’m standing, consumer 3D printers aren’t all that useful at spitting out truly helpful, long-lasting things. Most of what they generate is just cheap plastic, something that will break quickly, or be tossed out. They’re great for making trinkets and tchotchkes, but I don’t need any more of those. I really don’t need any &lt;em&gt;all all&lt;/em&gt;, come to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 3D printers can be a massive ballache. Bed leveling issues, filament issues, build plate issues, poor adhesion, wrong temperatures for the given material, stringing, you name it — the list goes on and on. I’m constantly watching, adjusting, tweaking, fiddling, and correcting it seems. But I can’t deny the joy of prying off a really great print from the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my wife, very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of the minimalist persuasion, adores when I print things for her. That alone makes the decision more difficult, and I suspect may sway the final vote in a different direction than it otherwise might go were I a single man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ultimately, I’m not sure if my 3D printer will make the move with me. Its fate is as of yet undecided.  But every day I look at it, whimpering in the corner, with contempt and derision, plotting how I might offload it onto some unsuspecting budding hobbyist.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On the Demise of Physical Media</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/02/24/physical-media.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/02/24/physical-media.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of folks in my online circles are lamenting the inevitable decline of physical media. I myself have shared similar sentiments, so I can’t blame anyone for feeling this way. My local Best Buy is in the process of completely clearing out the DVD and Blu-ray section, Target’s DVD isle has been replaced with books, and Walmart is starting to pull physical Xbox games (at Microsoft’s request). My gut reaction is to be sad about this, but the more I think about it, the more I think that our collective sadness about the loss of physical media may be misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of the strong belief that digital downloads and streaming aren’t the problem; it’s the digital rights management (DRM) that’s the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I had only one future ambition: &lt;em&gt;when I grow up&lt;/em&gt;, I told myself, &lt;em&gt;I want to own a copy of every movie and TV show I like!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, that goal seems quaint and easily achievable. What you have to understand is that, as a young person, I had very little money and each video I would purchase was a huge investment. The thought of being able to have a copy of everything seemed like such a far-off dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up wearing VHS tapes completely out, constantly keeping them on repeat on my TV (complete with built-in VCR). I would watch my movies time after time after time, until they would barely play in the tape deck any more. When DVDs came out I got a DVD player for Christmas (a bulky, heavy beast of a video player), and would watch movies on repeat until I had memorized every line. I can still quote the majority of &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/em&gt; by heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In adulthood, I don’t watch movies and TV with the same intensity or obsession as my younger self (I’m just too busy and don’t have the attention span that I used to). But I still love building and maintaining a media collection, and still regularly watch content from my library. I have hundreds of discs, ranging from 4K Blu-rays to DVD box sets, and everything in between. When given the option, I still buy a physical copy of everything I want to own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t do this because I specifically want a a physical copy of each film or TV show. What I love most about my movie collection isn’t that the majority of it is tangible. Having a digital movie stored on a round disc that I pop into the player isn’t especially important to me. What is important is the ability to watch my content wherever I want. As a Linux user for the past decade and a half, I’ve had to deal with issue after issue of not having content available to me. If I purchase a video from Apple TV (formerly iTunes), it will only play on Apple Devices, or devices that are compatible with the DRM scheme that they use. This rules out my laptop, which is my primary method of viewing content. It also limits me in terms of the types of set-top boxes I can connect directly to my TV. The same goes for other providers as well, such as Google/YouTube (they artificially limit the resolution to 720p for TV shows and 480p for movies), or Amazon (movies are limited to 480p there as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people enjoy the experience of physical media. They like organizing it and displaying it on shelves, they like looking through their collection to decide what to watch, and they like the act of physically loading a player with a copy of something. For those people, this sadness is perfectly placed. A purely digital experience, where everything is delivered electronically over the internet, will never replicate that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me at least, it isn’t the physical copy that I’m wanting, it’s the accessibility and freedom that a physical copy affords. It’s being able to watch the video on my laptop, or my phone, or a homemade media center (such as LibreELEC). It’s being able to lend a copy to a family member, and being able to put it into a video editor so I can make short clips, or turn them into GIFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I don’t really need or want a disc; I just want a file. A file that is not encumbered with DRM. A file that I can copy and backup, and generally exercise a modicum of control over. There have been plenty of instances of movie studios going back in and editing releases, and only making the modified versions available. Right now, physical copies are the best way to preserve original versions, but as long as you are able to store and preserve a digital file containing the original versions, there’s no reason why those can’t persist. In just about every scenario, the benefits of owning a physical copy don’t come down to the physicality of the item, but instead what you are able to practically do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say there aren’t benefits to a physical copy, beyond what you get out of just having a file. Being able to sell your unwanted media or purchase used media at a discounted rate is the biggest one I can think of. There are also cases to be made about exclusive bonus features that are only released on physical disc (although there’s no reason why this sort of content can’t be distributed digitally). But there are downsides, too. Physical discs take up a lot of storage space in your home. They are also prone to being lost or damaged, and even suffer from natural degradation over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, if I had my druthers, I’d keep physical media around forever. I must admit, though, that once physical media is gone, I won’t be sad. In most cases, the internet is a much better distribution method. File storage is cheap and getting cheaper. SSDs are getting bigger and bigger (so are hard disks, but I’ve had too many awful experiences with them to trust them any more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Times change, technology improves, and people vote with their dollars. There is a clear and obvious preference for digital downloads and streaming, whether we like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s the right fight for us to try and keep physical copies around forever. The right fight, the better fight, is against restrictive DRM.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cutting it Off and Feeling Nothing</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/02/19/feeling-nothing.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/02/19/feeling-nothing.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a line from the movie 500 Days of Summer that often plays in my head. The clip is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/hair.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but for those not wanting to watch a 20 second video, it involves a narrator telling us a little bit about the personality of a woman named Summer, in which he describes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since the disintegration of her parents marriage, she’d only loved two things: the first was her long, dark hair; and the second was how easily she could cut it off and feel nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was incredibly sentimental. Any time I was given a gift by someone, or any time I felt that something I owned was of unique importance, it was nearly impossible for me to get rid of it. It felt like a betrayal of trust, or a denial of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I’ve decidedly grown out of since then. Now, I find that with only the rarest of exceptions, I can mercilessly whittle down my personal collection of things without any hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within recent memory, I moved homes three time within a single year. Each time, fewer things made the trip. After the third move, it became an obsession of mine to remove as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, this past year, that drive kicked in harder and more forcefully than ever before. Starting home dialysis meant that I was suddenly inundated with hundreds of boxes of things that I needed to survive. I suppose the drive to remove all other non-essentials was a result of all that being foisted upon me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to get rid of everything I own, and there are still some things that mean a great deal to me. But by and large, I have trimmed all of my excess possessions, and am enjoying a leaner lifestyle with the handful of things I choose to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say, I’ve been a minimalist for a while, and that feeling has only grown over the past half decade. Much like Summer, I’m proud of how much I can cut things out, and feel nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kidney Transplant</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2024/02/15/kidney-transplant.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2024/02/15/kidney-transplant.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having spent lo these many years being an unabashed proponent of the “right to repair”, I’ve decided the time has come to put my money where my mouth is and apply those principles for myself in the most literal sense by swapping out a major organ. Thankfully, the part is standardized, and the repair guide is widely available for professionals in the field. Although I’m a big believer in getting your hands dirty and not being afraid to attempt a repair on your own, I think it best to leave this one to the experts. Unfortunately, the supply chain isn’t ideal, so acquiring replacement parts is a challenge. Thankfully, an incredibly kind soul has come forward to offer me a compatible part, at no charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I’m relieved, excited, nervous, and most of all, grateful, to say that I’ll be receiving a kidney transplant in just a couple weeks time. Out of respect to the donor’s privacy I won’t mention who is donating or their connection to me (just in case they want to remain anonymous), but this is such a selfless and enormous gift that I sometimes get choked up just thinking about it. I will never be able to thank them enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surgery I’ll be having will be done using a relatively new technique, involving robotics. I’ll be just one of a half dozen or so patients to have received this specific procedure. Once I’m out of surgery I’ll stay in the hospital for several days, will remain near the hospital for an additional week, and then will return home for another couple months of recovery (with frequent follow-up trips to make sure things keep working as expected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, a new chapter of my life will begin. There will be lots of lifestyle changes as a result, but many of them for the better. I’m excited to have more energy, more personal time, and more freedom to travel, spend time with friends and family, and be more involved in projects that matter to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made it 29 years on these two kidneys, but they’ve done all they came here to do. I’ll be turning 30 with a new kidney, a new perspective, and in many ways, a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Party</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/08/21/the-party.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/08/21/the-party.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, my eGFR number dropped to 13, placing me firmly in the “Stage 5 Kidney Disease” camp. I’m now essentially waiting for kidney failure, while trying to figure out what’s next for me in terms of treatment options (I suspect dialysis in the near future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to be morbid or dramatic, but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about this for the past week. Even though I’m going to be fine, I can’t stop thinking about the fact that I’m dying. Without medical intervention, I will be dead in just a short while. It’s &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once heard a quote, which to me perfectly encapsulates everything I’m feeling and thinking. Christopher Hitchens once remarked, “it will happen to all of us, that at some point you get tapped on the shoulder and told, not just that the party’s over, but slightly worse: the party’s going on — but you have to leave. And it’s going on without you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the hardest thought, to me at least. There’s so much more that I want to do in my life. So much more I want to see, to experience, to be a part of, to help shape. The party is going on; and although I know I’ll never see the end of it, I want to catch as much of it as possible. I’m just not ready to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zen and the Art of Actual Maintenance</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/06/25/zen-and-the-art-of-actual-maintenance.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/06/25/zen-and-the-art-of-actual-maintenance.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, I finally crossed a task off my to-do list that goes back half a decade and more failed attempts than I can count on one hand: I finally finished reading all of &lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zen&lt;/em&gt; is, without a doubt, the most frustrating book I’ve ever read. It’s frustrating because the first couple chapters feel as if the book was written specifically for me. Every word that is written connects with me on some level. I love the travel story, the father and son tale, the technical aspects that are specific to wrenching on a motorcycle, and the deeper ruminations of what it means to maintain something and the role that technology plays in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the multiple attempts at reading this book, I’ve flagged or highlighted the following sentences (which you’ll note, with just one exception, are all within the first 50 pages of the book):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You see things vacationing  on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other. In a car you’re always in a compartment, and because you’re used to it you don’t realize that through the car window everything you see is just more TV.” (pg 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Plans are deliberately indefinite, more to travel than to arrive anywhere.” (pg 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It seems natural and normal to me to make use of the small tool kits and instruction booklets supplied with each machine, and keep it tuned and adjusted myself. “ (pg 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about about it and want to get on to other things.” (pg 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is impractical, but practicality isn’t the whole thing with gloves or with anything else.” (pg 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Each machine has its own unique personality which probably could be defined as the intuitive sum total of everything you know and feel about it.” (pg 50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it’s a little better to travel than to arrive.” (pg 119)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These, I believe, illustrative the kind of book I wanted to read. One with little quips about the nature of keeping things running, of taking care of equipment, of being a custodian. And along the way, collecting pearls of wisdom about seeing the world, living deliberately, and taking the slow path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world, I am kind of obsessed with maintenance. I experience the zen of maintenance nearly every day. Nothing brings me more pleasure than fixing something that’s broken, or performing little tasks to make things work better or last longer. I am proud of the things I own and the things I have made, and show that appreciation by tending to their care. I had hoped to find a kindred spirit here with the author. And it started out so strong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, at this point in the book, the author manages to crawl up his own ass so far that the text becomes unreadable. It’s a miserable, tedious slog in which the author spends his time talking about how brilliant he is (or at least, an older version of himself before he drove himself to a mental breakdown) for coming up with a grand theory of “quality”, and how everything relates to quality. He tells of how he taught this in school, tirelessly recounts arguments and discussions he’s had about it with former students, and beats you over the head with it without actually saying anything substantive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every sentence he writes is trying to make you think he’s a genius. Nobody will ever be as impressed at his intelligence as much as he is. Each sentence, each chapter, grows more frustrating to read. In between these rambling bursts, you get treated to anecdotes of him being a really grumpy, awful father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, out of nowhere, Chapter 26 happens. And what a lovely, glorious chapter it is. Here, the author takes a break from talking about quality and focuses on a new word: gumption. Only this time, I think he really does have some interesting things to say about gumption. What it is. Why it’s necessary. Ways to increase it. Things that can cause it to dwindle. Real, practical advice, and often wrapped around various maintenance-related concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 26 is frustrating because it’s so good. This is the book I wanted to read! I wanted all 400 pages to be like this! I know this type of content is available, and within the author’s capabilities, and now more than ever I’m convinced the author is deliberating trying to torture me. What a tease!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As quickly as Chapter 26 arrives, it’s gone. Back to talking about quality. Back to trying to sound smarter than everyone else in the room. Back to referencing the greeks and debating himself over various schools of thought. It’s so tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I’m glad I finally finished it. Some might argue it was a waste of time, or that it’s best not to force yourself to continue reading something if you’re not enjoying it. I do generally agree with that; life’s short. But for me, this was a personal struggle that had bested me for the better part of a decade. If nothing else, I proved something about myself. I’m a little older, a little wiser, and more determined than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linkbuds Review</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/06/24/linkbuds.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/06/24/linkbuds.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been dealing with severe dizziness and nausea episodes for the past few months. Although not a constant issue (most days, anyway), when one of the dizziness spells happens it’s completely debilitating for at least a few hours. I’m still in the process of determining why these issues are happening (I’ve had MRIs, angiograms, and echocardiagrams, and so far everything is checking out okay - waiting for an ENT appointment next month), but in the interim, I’m trying to do all I can to prevent the episodes from happening, and trying to reduce the severity when they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be related to issues with my ears. For several weeks, I had a significant ear infection that took a while to resolve. They gave me antibiotics, and I’m already on steroids for my kidney disease, but on first glance they didn’t seem to correct the issue. Even after the antibiotics, the infection remained. Thankfully, that at least has cleared up in recent days. I suspect that it cleared up not only as a result of those medications, but also due to some lifestyle changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try and get ahead of the issue, I decided to stop wearing headphones and earbuds as much as possible. Between the pressure inside my ears, and the hot and sweaty feeling of my ears not being able to vent to the outside air while wearing them, I came to the conclusion that the earbud use was negatively affecting my ears and, by extension, my dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the decrease in usage, I’ve noticed a significant improvement not only in terms of the number of episodes I experience, but generally in just how my ears and sinuses feel. My ears feel so much better! The problem is, I really, really missed being able to listen to audio privately. I have a few Bluetooth speakers around my home and office, but I don’t like to disturb my partner or others at my coworking space, so I find that I am only able to use them occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to find another solution, I began to search the web for options. The most prevalent option I saw that might avoid the issues cause by headphones and earbuds were bone-conducting headphones. These are headphones that physically make contact with the side of your head, and channel the sound through the bones in your skull (staying outside of your ear canal). I’ve tried them in the past, but never liked them. They never got loud enough for me, and they always made my teeth feel like I was chewing on aluminum foil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I remembered a design for a set of earbuds I had seen a while ago. This is where the Sony Linkbuds come in. Sony Linkbuds are unique and somewhat strange. They are earbuds, but they don’t fit inside your ear canal. They rest right at the entrance, forming a small ring (almost like a donut) around the ear canal but never going in. They’re also, oddly enough, completely open in the middle. It’s strange to think of an “open back” earbud, but that’s what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your point of view, the downside of this is that you don’t get any noise cancellation or sound isolation. The sounds in your environment are still noticeable with them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it can also be a plus. Rather than the “transparency modes” of most noise canceling headphones, which essentially “pipe in” the sounds from outside, you’re getting the sounds directly and authentically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, most important of all, there is no feeling of pressure like with the other earbuds. There’s nothing in your canal, and nothing plugging anything up. You get sound, you get airflow, and your ears can breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are incredibly comfortable to wear. I could do with them being one notch louder, but they get plenty loud enough. And the sound is pretty good. They’re not as good in the sound department as noise-canceling earbuds, but you can’t expect them to be. And the health and lifestyle benefits you get in return are well worth that trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you, like me, find yourself having issues with normal earbuds and headphones, it may be worth giving the Linkbuds a try. I’m absolutely loving mine, and am overjoyed to be able to go about my day listening to music and podcasts again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nalgene Bottles</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/06/11/nalgene.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/06/11/nalgene.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple really nice water bottles: stainless steel, dual-walled with a vacuum to act as an insulator, and thick screw-on caps to keep leaks contained and prevent evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they don’t hold a candle to my Nalgene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my Nalgene water bottle for reasons that I’ve had a hard time pinpointing. Some of them are based on concrete facts. Others, I think, purely come down to personal preference and opinion. The truth is that, for whatever reason (I have speculations), when I drink out of a Nalgene, I drink more water throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stewing on it for a bit, I think I’ve figured out most of the reasons why I find the Nalgene to be the supreme portable water vessel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s easy to keep track of the amount of water you’re drinking. The material is transparent and has markings on the outside to show how much water is left in the bottle. And, best of all, it shows not only U.S. imperial measurements but metric as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The wide mouth makes it easier to fill, easier to drink out of, and more easily accommodates ice for times when you want it as cold as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re dishwasher safe and can just be chucked into the top rack at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are inexpensive and understated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s almost impossible to lose the cap, because it’s attached with a strap. If you do, you can always get a replacement strap (&lt;a href=&quot;%5B%3Chttps://www.printables.com/model/263684-nalgene-bottle-strap%3E%5D(%3Chttps://www.printables.com/model/263684-nalgene-bottle-strap%3E)&quot;&gt;or 3D print your own&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are ludicrously durable. They are almost impossible to kill. You can drop them from great heights, or onto traditionally unforgiving ground (looking at you, concrete), yet they almost always bounce off. And, over time, the scuffs and scratches just give it a charming patina.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a community of people who make cool stuff for Nalgenes. Because the sizes are consistent (I hesitate to call them “standardized”), it’s easy to find accessories or even 3D print them. My favorites include adapters for car cup holders so they can fit the wider bottles, as well as bicycle water cages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In that vein, they’re great for customization purposes! They come in a wide variety of colors (including bottles, straps, and lids), so it’s easy to find something that suits your preferences and tells the world a little about you. You can also cover them in stickers (just don’t run it through the dishwasher if you do).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This isn’t something I personally have used, but I know they’re loved for being very versatile. The measurements on the side make them suitable for use in measuring and storing a plethora of ingredients. And, because they’re BPA free and have a melting point above the boiling point of water, it’s safe to store hot water in them if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s to you, Nalgene bottle! Thanks for keeping me hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On The Turning Away</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/06/05/on-the-turning-away.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/06/05/on-the-turning-away.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past couple years, my enjoyment of social media as a concept has really waned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first joined Twitter a decade and a half ago, I fell in love with it immediately. The vibe in those early days was incredible. There was boundless positivity, incredible potential, and real connections with other human beings (even if it was just to know what someone was eating for lunch on a given day). People spoke about the amazing things they were working on, or the things they had made, or neat things they purchased, or the news items of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to wake up excited to read through my Twitter feed, catching every single Tweet from the overnight timeline, and then keeping a little window with tweets streaming in the background all day long so I wouldn’t miss anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, as time moved forward, the joy began to diminish. People spent less time posting about interesting and useful things, and spent more time arguing with one another. Good faith discussions turned into bitter disagreements. It felt like everyone was upset all the time, and the only news that surfaced was either negative or misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I joined Mastodon, after also having joined other social networks including Google+ and Indenti.ca. For a while, things on Mastodon moved slowly. There weren’t a lot of folks. But for those who were there, it felt like the old days again. Everyone was friendly. The vibes were good. I began to enjoy social media again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Elon Musk took over Twitter. I decided to delete my account soon after. Most of the folks I followed on Twitter made it over to a Mastodon instance. Some, unfortunately, did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, it was amazing having everyone back on this new service, and interacting in positive ways. But now, I feel again that I’m just sitting back and staring into a bad news machine. It’s almost nothing but negativity and infighting. Or, posts about the bleak state of the world; folks’ rights being taken away, crimes being committed, social systems failing, and business and corporations destroying the planet while making the lives of everyday people worse, just to pad their bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I’m enjoying social media less and less. I can envision a future where I don’t have any social apps installed, and I don’t generally interact with folks outside of my work / email. But that also feels bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once saw a Jon Stewart clip where he was talking about people deciding not to have children because of environmental concerns. Everyone’s decision to have or not have children is their own, and environmental worries are as valid a reason as any not to have them, but he said something that has nevertheless stuck with me: “if you don’t have kids, who are you saving the world &lt;em&gt;for?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about that in the context of work that I do: the code that I write, the contributions I make, the donations I send, and the causes that I fight for. I want to be reminded of the people that will benefit from these actions and these choices. I want to be reminded of why I even bother getting out of bed in the morning. I don’t want to live isolated, thinking only of myself, excluding everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I don’t think completely leaving social media is the right answer for me. I think, it many ways, it’s an avoidance of the problem, or may even exacerbate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I do not find myself enjoying the current forms of social media, nor what it’s doing for my mental health. Maybe I need to find new folks to follow? Or maybe I need to prune my own following list? But choosing to avoid difficult or challening subjects can sometimes be an expression of privilege, and I don’t want to completely ignore the struggles of others. I want to be a friend and ally for folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what the answers are. There probably aren’t any right answers, just “less bad” ones. I only mention this here to note how I’m feeling, and perhaps to help someone else know they’re not alone if they’re feeling this way too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Induction Hobs</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2023/05/28/induction-hobs.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2023/05/28/induction-hobs.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking&quot;&gt;induction hob&lt;/a&gt; for the first time today, and it was an unexpectedly enchanting experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been aware of the idea of cooking with induction for a while. In the debate about cooking with natural gas versus electricity, induction inevitably gets presented as the clear winner. “Yeah, the old electric stoves sucked, but induction is great!” I’ve heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never quite understood the hype, because I quite literally &lt;em&gt;didn’t understand&lt;/em&gt; what an induction hob is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, I had mistakenly thought that I’ve been using induction stoves for most of my recent life. As far as I could tell, any kitchen range that did not include the circular coils on top were using induction. I mean, what else could they be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ceramic glass, it turns out. Those ranges I’ve been using and incorrectly thinking were induction were simply ceramic glass. The heating coils (or lamps, depending on the model) are located underneath the glass surface, and the heat is transferred straight up. They’re easier to clean than the old coil stove eyes, and marginally safer, but they are very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; induction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m staying at an AirBNB with an induction hob, and immediately after powering it on the user experience was unfamiliar to me. I swithced it on, but aside from a fan, it just starred at me with a blinking seven-segment display. I pressed the button to crank up the power, but it stubbornly refused to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put my pan on the stove and tried again: E01, it grouchily answered. &lt;em&gt;An error!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than using my own pan, I reached into the cabinet and grabbed a heavier stainless steel frying pan, and sat it on the eye. Immediately, it danced to life. I turned the power up, and it responded quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instantaneously, the pan grew hot to the touch. The oil was warm. The food started cooking. It was so pleasant, and efficient, and it cooked evenly in a way that previously I had only experienced with propane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I heated up a can of soup with it. Tonight, I’m trying spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only used it a few times now, but each time I am astounded at how quickly it heats up, how evenly it cooks, and how great the user experience is (once you use a compatible pan). I have a feeling this is going to be become one of those things I swear by!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I tell people I want to purchase an old Volkswagen Beetle I typically get a response somewhere on the spectrum between “why the hell would you want one of those old pieces of junk?” to “what are you, nuts?!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ll grant you that in the intervening years —  er, decades — er, half-centuries — since they first were introduced to the world, technology has advanced and there are certain modern conveniences and safety features which are generally considered to be “good” that simply aren’t available on these older Beetles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what many people fail to appreciate is how beautifully engineered almost every facet of the classic Beetles was, in relation to both competition back in the day, and when comparing to modern cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big believer in walkable cities, better biking infrastructure, and eliminating as many cars from the road as possible, so I know it’s a bit of a contradiction to be wanting a vehicle like this. But then again, I find myself holding opposing thoughts in my mind all the time, so we can add one more onto the heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to share a few examples of the ways in which the Beetle was a triumph (and then, in the following paragraphs, walk it back and share a few ways in which it was not):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great fuel economy, particularly for its time (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMysDLf2l74&quot;&gt;”An Honest 25 mpg”&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interchangeable parts from one model year to the next&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to repair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parts easily accessible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highly customizable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lovely touches and ingenious designs (like the windshield washer fluid being pressurized by the spare tire, which I’ll discuss more below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that every design decision is a good one. One wacky thing is that the windshield wiper fluid reservoir does not rely on any kind of electrical pump; instead, the fluid is held in a tank that is pressurized by the spare tire in the frunk, and tugging on the lever opens a valve and allows the pressurized fluid to squirt up on the windshield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is, of course, that each time you use the wiper fluid it lets out a small amount of air from the tire, and over a relatively short period of time your spare tire will go flat. The corollary issue is that if your spare tire is flat, your fluid won’t squirt, so if your windshield gets obstructed you’re basically out of luck until you stop and refill your spare’s air (granted, you really shouldn’t be driving with a flat spare anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then that brings you to the other little modern touches that you might find missing, such as an air conditioner, or power windows, or power &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; really. And the fact that the only heater is a hose coming from the engine bay, which when opened all the way can melt your sneakers (but still not quite keep the rest of your body toasty on a cold day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who cares about air conditioning, when you have a car with such character, that makes such a neat little sound as it putters along. And did I mention the frunk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world in which I have tons of expendable income, I would absolutely buy an old beat-up Beetle, fix it up, and then add some classy, modern touches. A popular modification is to turn old Beetles into electric cars, but where I live, I’m not sure that’s quite feasible yet. I’d be happy to instead make an “open source” car, where sensors keep track of everything in computers that are all running open source code, and all the modern gadgets like music playback, GPS guidance, etc., are all open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open source Beetle. A man can dream!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gizmos and the Data They Generate</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a fairly privacy-conscious person, some people might be surprised to hear how much I like recording data about myself. I have a few serious medical issues, so keeping on top of stats about my body and overall well-being is a great thing. Of course, I’m also a geek at heart and love data that can tell a story or paint a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of devices with sensors on board to record copious amounts of data about what is happening inside and around my body, and software to make sense of the data. That’s all fine and good. The problem I have is with the next step that many of the devices take, which is to sync that data with a cloud service, and then sell that data to third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that as wearables and digital medical devices continue to proliferate, we need to only support and use ones that meet the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should always have the ability to pause data recording (“incognito mode”). There are times when you really don’t want your gizmo recording your activity or generating any new data, and triggering that should be one or two taps away, max.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data it captures should be available in a standard format, that you can easily export. Data that only exists inside of a proprietary app with no way of pulling it into another application of your choice is designed to lock you into an ecosystem, and make your data something the company can sell for profit. Interoperability is absolutely critical.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data should be stored on-device, and only synchronized to severs when you give express permission. And that behavior should be auditable, so you can make sure that the vendors are staying honest about it (which is part of why I also think those devices should be running open source code).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as devices follow those rules, then I’m happy to wear them on my body, and the data they provide is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
