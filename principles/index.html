    <h1>Principles</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand your place in the ecosystem. Self-reliance is a myth. Your actions affect others, and their actions affect you. Try to maximize positive outcomes for others, and within reason, limit how much others' actions can affect you. But donâ€™t be afraid to ask for help when you need it.</li>
        <li>You only have one life. You have only one home planet.</li>
        <li>There are no shortcuts. Anything worth doing is worth over-doing.</li>
        <li>Having really good versions of a few things is better than a lot of mediocre things. Quality counts. Function is always the primary consideration, but do not discount form. Aesthetics and usability matter. Do research, find the best, and spend the extra cash.</li>
        <li>Value reliability over new and shiny. Repair things rather than buying new ones, when you can. Only buy devices that can be opened and repaired by anyone. No black boxes.</li>
        <li>Give back to people and communities that improve your life. Return value for value. Be charitable with both time and money.</li>
        <li>Let people know they are appreciated. Always make time for friends.</li>
        <li>The ultimate measure of a person or organization is integrity. Do their actions actually match what they say?</li>
        <li>With few exceptions, a person is entitled to privacy. That's not to say that they can't share as much as they like, but having the autonomy to make that determination is key.</li>
        <li>Avoid algorithms that make decisions on your behalf.</li>
        <li>Home is a feeling, not a place.</li>
    </ol>
