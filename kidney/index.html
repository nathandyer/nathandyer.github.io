    <h1>Please Consider a Life Saving Kidney Donation ðŸ«˜</h1>
    <p>I have a rare autoimmune disease (IgA vasculitis) that has resulted in kidney disease (IgA nephropathy). I'm currently in kidney failure, and undergoing hemodialysis treatments 12 hours per week.</p>
    <p>I had a kidney transplant on March 4th, 2024 that failed due to a rare complication arising from a blood clot in the transplanted kidney. I'm now searching for someone who might be willing to consider a life-changing organ donation. If you want to hear more of that story, please see <a href="https://nathandyer.me/2024/08/28/when-kidney-transplants-go-wrong.html">this blog post.</a></p>
    <p>If you're willing to consider a donation, you can start the screening process here: <a href="https://duke.donorscreen.org/register/now">https://duke.donorscreen.org/register/now</a></p>
    <p>Even if you don't live near me, or aren't a good match, you can still donate. ANY healthy adult in the U.S. is a potential candidate.</p>
    <p>Thank you for considering, or sharing the word with others!</p>
